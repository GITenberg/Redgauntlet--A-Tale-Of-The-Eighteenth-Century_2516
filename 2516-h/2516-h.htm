    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Jacobite enthusiasm of the eighteenth century, particularly during the
      rebellion of 1745, afforded a theme, perhaps the finest that could be
      selected for fictitious composition, founded upon real or probable
      incident. This civil war and its remarkable events were remembered by the
      existing generation without any degree of the bitterness of spirit which
      seldom fails to attend internal dissension. The Highlanders, who formed
      the principal strength of Charles Edward&rsquo;s army, were an ancient and
      high-spirited race, peculiar in their habits of war and of peace, brave to
      romance, and exhibiting a character turning upon points more adapted to
      poetry than to the prose of real life. Their prince, young, valiant,
      patient of fatigue, and despising danger, heading his army on foot in the
      most toilsome marches, and defeating a regular force in three battles&mdash;all
      these were circumstances fascinating to the imagination, and might well be
      supposed to seduce young and enthusiastic minds to the cause in which they
      were found united, although wisdom and reason frowned upon the enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The adventurous prince, as is well known, proved to be one of those
      personages who distinguish themselves during some single and
      extraordinarily brilliant period of their lives, like the course of a
      shooting-star, at which men wonder, as well on account of the briefness,
      as the brilliancy of its splendour. A long tract of darkness overshadowed
      the subsequent life of a man who, in his youth, showed himself so capable
      of great undertakings; and, without the painful task of tracing his course
      farther, we may say the latter pursuits and habits of this unhappy prince
      are those painfully evincing a broken heart, which seeks refuge from its
      own thoughts in sordid enjoyments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, however, it was long ere Charles Edward appeared to be, perhaps it
      was long ere he altogether became, so much degraded from his original
      self; as he enjoyed for a time the lustre attending the progress and
      termination of his enterprise. Those who thought they discerned in his
      subsequent conduct an insensibility to the distresses of his followers,
      coupled with that egotistical attention to his own interests which has
      been often attributed to the Stuart family, and which is the natural
      effect of the principles of divine right in which they were brought up,
      were now generally considered as dissatisfied and splenetic persons, who,
      displeased with the issue of their adventure and finding themselves
      involved in the ruins of a falling cause, indulged themselves in
      undeserved reproaches against their leader. Indeed, such censures were by
      no means frequent among those of his followers who, if what was alleged
      had been just, had the best right to complain. Far the greater number of
      those unfortunate gentlemen suffered with the most dignified patience, and
      were either too proud to take notice of ill-treatment an the part of their
      prince, or so prudent as to be aware their complaints would meet with
      little sympathy from the world. It may be added, that the greater part of
      the banished Jacobites, and those of high rank and consequence, were not
      much within reach of the influence of the prince&rsquo;s character and conduct,
      whether well regulated or otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime that great Jacobite conspiracy, of which the insurrection
      of 1745-6 was but a small part precipitated into action on the failure of
      a far more general scheme, was resumed and again put into motion by the
      Jacobites of England, whose force had never been broken, as they had
      prudently avoided bringing it into the field. The surprising effect which
      had been produced by small means, in 1745-6, animated their hopes for more
      important successes, when the whole nonjuring interest of Britain,
      identified as it then was with great part of the landed gentlemen, should
      come forward to finish what had been gallantly attempted by a few Highland
      chiefs.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is probable, indeed, that the Jacobites of the day were incapable of
      considering that the very small scale on which the effort was made, was in
      one great measure the cause of its unexpected success. The remarkable
      speed with which the insurgents marched, the singularly good discipline
      which they preserved, the union and unanimity which for some time animated
      their councils, were all in a considerable degree produced by the
      smallness of their numbers. Notwithstanding the discomfiture of Charles
      Edward, the nonjurors of the period long continued to nurse unlawful
      schemes, and to drink treasonable toasts, until age stole upon them.
      Another generation arose, who did not share the sentiments which they
      cherished; and at length the sparkles of disaffection, which had long
      smouldered, but had never been heated enough to burst into actual flame,
      became entirely extinguished. But in proportion as the political
      enthusiasm died gradually away among men of ordinary temperament, it
      influenced those of warm imaginations and weak understandings, and hence
      wild schemes were formed, as desperate as they were adventurous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus a young Scottishman of rank is said to have stooped so low as to plot
      the surprisal of St. James&rsquo;s Palace, and the assassination of the royal
      family. While these ill-digested and desperate conspiracies were agitated
      among the few Jacobites who still adhered with more obstinacy to their
      purpose, there is no question but that other plots might have been brought
      to an open explosion, had it not suited the policy of Sir Robert Walpole
      rather to prevent or disable the conspirators in their projects, than to
      promulgate the tale of danger, which might thus have been believed to be
      more widely diffused than was really the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one instance alone this very prudential and humane line of conduct was
      departed from, and the event seemed to confirm the policy of the general
      course. Doctor Archibald Cameron, brother of the celebrated Donald Cameron
      of Lochiel, attainted for the rebellion of 1745, was found by a party of
      soldiers lurking with a comrade in the wilds of Loch Katrine five or six
      years after the battle of Culloden, and was there seized. There were
      circumstances in his case, so far as was made known to the public, which
      attracted much compassion, and gave to the judicial proceedings against
      him an appearance of cold-blooded revenge on the part of government; and
      the following argument of a zealous Jacobite in his favour, was received
      as conclusive by Dr. Johnson and other persons who might pretend to
      impartiality. Dr. Cameron had never borne arms, although engaged in the
      Rebellion, but used his medical skill for the service, indifferently, of
      the wounded of both parties. His return to Scotland was ascribed
      exclusively to family affairs. His behaviour at the bar was decent, firm,
      and respectful. His wife threw herself, on three different occasions,
      before George II and the members of his family, was rudely repulsed from
      their presence, and at length placed, it was said, in the same prison with
      her husband, and confined with unmanly severity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Cameron was finally executed with all the severities of the law of
      treason; and his death remains in popular estimation a dark blot upon the
      memory of George II, being almost publicly imputed to a mean and personal
      hatred of Donald Cameron of Lochiel, the sufferer&rsquo;s heroic brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the fact was that whether the execution of Archibald Cameron was
      political or otherwise, it might certainly have been justified, had the
      king&rsquo;s ministers so pleased, upon reasons of a public nature. The
      unfortunate sufferer had not come to the Highlands solely upon his private
      affairs, as was the general belief; but it was not judged prudent by the
      English ministry to let it be generally known that he came to inquire
      about a considerable sum of money which had been remitted from France to
      the friends of the exiled family. He had also a commission to hold
      intercourse with the well-known M&rsquo;Pherson of Cluny, chief of the clan
      Vourich, whom the Chevalier had left behind at his departure from Scotland
      in 1746, and who remained during ten years of proscription and danger,
      skulking from place to place in the Highlands, and maintaining an
      uninterrupted correspondence between Charles and his friends. That Dr.
      Cameron should have held a commission to assist this chief in raking
      together the dispersed embers of disaffection, is in itself sufficiently
      natural, and, considering his political principles, in no respect
      dishonourable to his memory. But neither ought it to be imputed to George
      II that he suffered the laws to be enforced against a person taken in the
      act of breaking them. When he lost his hazardous game, Dr. Cameron only
      paid the forfeit which he must have calculated upon. The ministers,
      however, thought it proper to leave Dr. Cameron&rsquo;s new schemes in
      concealment, lest, by divulging them, they had indicated the channel of
      communication which, it is now well known, they possessed to all the plots
      of Charles Edward. But it was equally ill advised and ungenerous to
      sacrifice the character of the king to the policy of the administration.
      Both points might have been gained by sparing the life of Dr. Cameron
      after conviction, and limiting his punishment to perpetual exile.
    </p>
    <p>
      These repeated and successive Jacobite plots rose and burst like bubbles
      on a fountain; and one of them, at least, the Chevalier judged of
      importance enough to induce him to risk himself within the dangerous
      precincts of the British capital. This appears from Dr. King&rsquo;s ANECDOTES
      OF HIS OWN TIMES.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;September, 1750.&mdash;I received a note from my Lady Primrose, who
      desired to see me immediately. As soon as I waited on her, she led me into
      her dressing-room, and presented me to&mdash;&rsquo; [the Chevalier, doubtless].
      &lsquo;If I was surprised to find him there, I was still more astonished when he
      acquainted me with the motives which had induced him to hazard a journey
      to England at this juncture. The impatience of his friends who were in
      exile had formed a scheme which was impracticable; but although it had
      been as feasible as they had represented it to him, yet no preparation had
      been made, nor was anything ready to carry it into execution. He was soon
      convinced that he had been deceived; and, therefore, after a stay in
      London of five days only, he returned to the place from whence he came.&rsquo; 
      Dr. King was in 1750 a keen Jacobite, as may be inferred from the visit
      made by him to the prince under such circumstances, and from his being one
      of that unfortunate person&rsquo;s chosen correspondents. He, as well as other
      men of sense and observation, began to despair of making their fortune in
      the party which they had chosen. It was indeed sufficiently dangerous;
      for, during the short visit just described, one of Dr. King&rsquo;s servants
      remarked the stranger&rsquo;s likeness to Prince Charles, whom he recognized
      from the common busts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The occasion taken for breaking up the Stuart interest we shall tell in
      Dr. King&rsquo;s own words:&mdash;&lsquo;When he (Charles Edward) was in Scotland, he
      had a mistress whose name was Walkinshaw, and whose sister was at that
      time, and is still, housekeeper at Leicester House. Some years after he
      was released from his prison, and conducted out of France, he sent for
      this girl, who soon acquired such a dominion over him, that she was
      acquainted with all his schemes, and trusted with his most secret
      correspondence. As soon as this was known in England, all those persons of
      distinction who were attached to him were greatly alarmed: they imagined
      that this wench had been placed in his family by the English ministers;
      and, considering her sister&rsquo;s situation, they seemed to have some ground
      for their suspicion; wherefore, they dispatched a gentleman to Paris,
      where the prince then was, who had instructions to insist that Mrs.
      Walkinshaw should be removed to a convent for a certain term; but her
      gallant absolutely refused to comply with this demand; and although Mr.
      M&rsquo;Namara, the gentleman who was sent to him, who has a natural eloquence
      and an excellent understanding, urged the most cogent reasons, and used
      all the arts of persuasion, to induce him to part with his mistress, and
      even proceeded so far as to assure him, according to his instructions,
      that an immediate interruption of all correspondence with his most
      powerful friends in England, and, in short, that the ruin of his interest,
      which was now daily increasing, would be the infallible consequence of his
      refusal; yet he continued inflexible, and all M&rsquo;Namara&rsquo;s entreaties and
      remonstrances were ineffectual. M&rsquo;Namara stayed in Paris some days beyond
      the time prescribed him, endeavouring to reason the prince into a better
      temper; but finding him obstinately persevere in his first answer, he took
      his leave with concern and indignation, saying, as he passed out, &ldquo;What
      has your family done, sir, thus to draw down the vengeance of Heaven on
      every branch of it, through so many ages?&rdquo; It is worthy of remark, that in
      all the conferences which M&rsquo;Namara had with the prince on this occasion,
      the latter declared that it was not a violent passion, or indeed any
      particular regard, which attached him to Mrs. Walkinshaw and that he could
      see her removed from him without any concern; but he would not receive
      directions, in respect to his private conduct, from any man alive. When
      M&rsquo;Namara returned to London, and reported the prince&rsquo;s answer to the
      gentlemen who had employed him, they were astonished and confounded.
      However, they soon resolved on the measures which they were to pursue for
      the future, and determined no longer to serve a man who could not be
      persuaded to serve himself, and chose rather to endanger the lives of his
      best and most faithful friends, than part with an harlot, whom, as he
      often declared, he neither loved nor esteemed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      From this anecdote, the general truth of which is indubitable, the
      principal fault of Charles Edward&rsquo;s temper is sufficiently obvious. It was
      a high sense of his own importance, and an obstinate adherence to what he
      had once determined on&mdash;qualities which, if he had succeeded in his
      bold attempt, gave the nation little room to hope that he would have been
      found free from the love of prerogative and desire of arbitrary power,
      which characterized his unhappy grandfather. He gave a notable instance
      how far this was the leading feature of his character, when, for no
      reasonable cause that can be assigned, he placed his own single will in
      opposition to the necessities of France, which, in order to purchase a
      peace become necessary to the kingdom, was reduced to gratify Britain by
      prohibiting the residence of Charles within any part of the French
      dominions. It was in vain that France endeavoured to lessen the disgrace
      of this step by making the most flattering offers, in hopes to induce the
      prince of himself to anticipate this disagreeable alternative, which, if
      seriously enforced, as it was likely to be, he had no means whatever of
      resisting, by leaving the kingdom as of his own free will. Inspired,
      however, by the spirit of hereditary obstinacy, Charles preferred a
      useless resistance to a dignified submission, and, by a series of idle
      bravadoes, laid the French court under the necessity of arresting their
      late ally, and sending him to close confinement in the Bastille, from
      which he was afterwards sent out of the French dominions, much in the
      manner in which a convict is transported to the place of his destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to these repeated instances of a rash and inflexible temper,
      Dr. King also adds faults alleged to belong to the prince&rsquo;s character, of
      a kind less consonant with his noble birth and high pretensions. He is
      said by this author to have been avaricious, or parsimonious at least, to
      such a degree of meanness, as to fail, even when he had ample means, in
      relieving the sufferers who had lost their fortune, and sacrificed all in
      his ill-fated attempt. [The approach is thus expressed by Dr. King, who
      brings the charge:&mdash;&lsquo;But the most odious part of his character is his
      love of money, a vice which I do not remember to have been imputed by our
      historians to any of his ancestors, and is the certain index of a base and
      little mind. I know it may be urged in his vindication, that a prince in
      exile ought to be an economist. And so he ought; but, nevertheless, his
      purse should be always open as long as there is anything in it, to relieve
      the necessities of his friends and adherents. King Charles II, during his
      banishment, would have shared the last pistole in his pocket with his
      little family. But I have known this gentleman, with two thousand
      louis-d&rsquo;ors in his strong-box, pretend he was in great distress, and
      borrow money from a lady in Paris who was not in affluent circumstances.
      His most faithful servants, who had closely attended him in all his
      difficulties, were ill rewarded.&rsquo;&mdash;King&rsquo;s MEMOIRS.] We must receive,
      however, with some degree of jealousy what is said by Dr. King on this
      subject, recollecting that he had left at least, if he did not desert, the
      standard of the unfortunate prince, and was not therefore a person who was
      likely to form the fairest estimate of his virtues and faults. We must
      also remember that if the exiled prince gave little, he had but little to
      give, especially considering how late he nourished the scheme of another
      expedition to Scotland, for which he was long endeavouring to hoard money.
    </p>
    <p>
      The case, also, of Charles Edward must be allowed to have been a difficult
      one. He had to satisfy numerous persons, who, having lost their all in his
      cause, had, with that all, seen the extinction of hopes which they
      accounted nearly as good as certainties; some of these were perhaps
      clamorous in their applications, and certainly ill pleased with their want
      of success. Other parts of the Chevalier&rsquo;s conduct may have afforded
      grounds for charging him with coldness to the sufferings of his devoted
      followers. One of these was a sentiment which has nothing in it that is
      generous, but it was certainly a principle in which the young prince was
      trained, and which may be too probably denominated peculiar to his family,
      educated in all the high notions of passive obedience and non-resistance.
      If the unhappy prince gave implicit faith to the professions of statesmen
      holding such notions, which is implied by his whole conduct.

      LETTER I
    </h2>
    <h3>
      DARSIE LATIMER TO ALAN FAIRFORD
    </h3>
    <p>
      DUMFRIES.
    </p>
    <p>
      CUR ME EXANIMAS QUERELIS TUIS? In plain English, Why do you deafen me with
      your croaking? The disconsolate tone in which you bade me farewell at
      Noble House, [The first stage on the road from Edinburgh to Dumfries via
      Moffat.] and mounted your miserable hack to return to your law drudgery,
      still sounds in my ears. It seemed to say, &lsquo;Happy dog! you can ramble at
      pleasure over hill and dale, pursue every object of curiosity that
      presents itself, and relinquish the chase when it loses interest; while I,
      your senior and your better, must, in this brilliant season, return to my
      narrow chamber and my musty books.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the import of the reflections with which you saddened our parting
      bottle of claret, and thus I must needs interpret the terms of your
      melancholy adieu.
    </p>
    <p>
      And why should this be so, Alan? Why the deuce should you not be sitting
      precisely opposite to me at this moment, in the same comfortable George
      Inn; thy heels on the fender, and thy juridical brow expanding its
      plications as a pun rose in your fancy? Above all, why, when I fill this
      very glass of wine, cannot I push the bottle to you, and say, &lsquo;Fairford,
      you are chased!&rsquo; Why, I say, should not all this be, except because Alan
      Fairford has not the same true sense of friendship as Darsie Latimer, and
      will not regard our purses as common, as well as our sentiments?
    </p>
    <p>
      I am alone in the world; my only guardian writes to me of a large fortune
      which will be mine when I reach the age of twenty-five complete; my
      present income is, thou knowest, more than sufficient for all my wants;
      and yet thou&mdash;traitor as thou art to the cause of friendship&mdash;dost
      deprive me of the pleasure of thy society, and submittest, besides, to
      self-denial on thine own part, rather than my wanderings should cost me a
      few guineas more! Is this regard for my purse, or for thine own pride? Is
      it not equally absurd and unreasonable, whichever source it springs from?
      For myself, I tell thee, I have, and shall have, more than enough for
      both. This same methodical Samuel Griffiths, of Ironmonger Lane,
      Guildhall, London, whose letter arrives as duly as quarter-day, has sent
      me, as I told thee, double allowance for this my twenty-first birthday,
      and an assurance, in his brief fashion, that it will be again doubled for
      the succeeding years, until I enter into possession of my own property.
      Still I am to refrain from visiting England until my twenty-fifth year
      expires; and it is recommended that I shall forbear all inquiries
      concerning my family, and so forth, for the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were it not that I recollect my poor mother in her deep widow&rsquo;s weeds,
      with a countenance that never smiled but when she looked on me&mdash;and
      then, in such wan and woful sort, as the sun when he glances through an
      April cloud,&mdash;were it not, I say, that her mild and matron-like form
      and countenance forbid such a suspicion, I might think myself the son of
      some Indian director, or rich citizen, who had more wealth than grace, and
      a handful of hypocrisy to boot, and who was breeding up privately, and
      obscurely enriching, one of whose existence he had some reason to be
      ashamed. But, as I said before, I think on my mother, and am convinced as
      much as of the existence of my own soul, that no touch of shame could
      arise from aught in which she was implicated. Meantime, I am wealthy, and
      I am alone, and why does my friend scruple to share my wealth?
    </p>
    <p>
      Are you not my only friend? and have you not acquired a right to share my
      wealth? Answer me that, Alan Fairford. When I was brought from the
      solitude of my mother&rsquo;s dwelling into the tumult of the Gaits&rsquo; Class at
      the High School&mdash;when I was mocked for my English accent&mdash;salted
      with snow as a Southern&mdash;rolled in the gutter for a Saxon
      pock-pudding,&mdash;who, with stout arguments and stouter blows, stood
      forth my defender?&mdash;why, Alan Fairford. Who beat me soundly when I
      brought the arrogance of an only son, and of course a spoiled urchin, to
      the forms of the little republic?&mdash;why, Alan. And who taught me to
      smoke a cobbler, pin a losen, head a bicker, and hold the bannets?&mdash;[Break
      a window, head a skirmish with stones, and hold the bonnet, or
      handkerchief, which used to divide High School boys when fighting.] Alan,
      once more. If I became the pride of the Yards, and the dread of the
      hucksters in the High School Wynd, it was under thy patronage; and, but
      for thee, I had been contented with humbly passing through the Cowgate
      Port, without climbing over the top of it, and had never seen the KITTLE
      NINE-STEPS nearer than from Bareford&rsquo;s Parks. [A pass on the very brink of
      the Castle rock to the north, by which it is just possible for a goat, or
      a High School boy, to turn the corner of the building where it rises from
      the edge of the precipice. This was so favourite a feat with the &lsquo;hell and
      neck boys&rsquo; of the higher classes, that at one time sentinels were posted
      to prevent its repetition. One of the nine-steps was rendered more secure
      because the climber could take hold of the root of a nettle, so precarious
      were the means of passing this celebrated spot. The manning the Cowgate
      Port, especially in snowball time, was also a choice amusement, as it
      offered an inaccessible station for the boys who used these missiles to
      the annoyance of the passengers. The gateway is now demolished; and
      probably most of its garrison lie as low as the fortress. To recollect
      that the author himself, however naturally disqualified, was one of those
      juvenile dreadnoughts, is a sad reflection to one who cannot now step over
      a brook without assistance.]
    </p>
    <p>
      You taught me to keep my fingers off the weak, and to clench my fist
      against the strong&mdash;to carry no tales out of school&mdash;to stand
      forth like a true man&mdash;obey the stern order of a PANDE MANUM, and
      endure my pawmies without wincing, like one that is determined not to be
      the better for them. In a word, before I knew thee, I knew nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At college it was the same. When I was incorrigibly idle, your example and
      encouragement roused me to mental exertion, and showed me the way to
      intellectual enjoyment. You made me an historian, a metaphysician (INVITA
      MINERVA)&mdash;nay, by Heaven! you had almost made an advocate of me, as
      well as of yourself. Yes, rather than part with you, Alan, I attended a
      weary season at the Scotch Law Class; a wearier at the Civil; and with
      what excellent advantage, my notebook, filled with caricatures of the
      professors and my fellow students, is it not yet extant to testify?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   Thus far have I held on with thee untired;
</pre>
    <p>
      and, to say truth, purely and solely that I might travel the same road
      with thee. But it will not do, Alan. By my faith, man, I could as soon
      think of being one of those ingenious traders who cheat little Master
      Jackies on the outside of the partition with tops, balls, bats, and
      battledores, as a member of the long-robed fraternity within, who impose
      on grown country gentlemen with bouncing brocards of law. [The Hall of the
      Parliament House of Edinburgh was, in former days, divided into two
      unequal portions by a partition, the inner side of which was consecrated
      to the use of the Courts of Justice and the gentlemen of the law; while
      the outer division was occupied by the stalls of stationers, toymen, and
      the like, as in a modern bazaar. From the old play of THE PLAIN DEALER, it
      seems such was formerly the case with Westminster Hall. Minos has now
      purified his courts in both cities from all traffic but his own.] Now,
      don&rsquo;t you read this to your worthy father, Alan&mdash;he loves me well
      enough, I know, of a Saturday night; but he thinks me but idle company for
      any other day of the week. And here, I suspect, lies your real objection
      to taking a ramble with me through the southern counties in this delicious
      weather. I know the good gentleman has hard thoughts of me for being so
      unsettled as to leave Edinburgh before the Session rises; perhaps, too, he
      quarrels a little&mdash;I will not say with my want of ancestry, but with
      my want of connexions. He reckons me a lone thing in this world, Alan, and
      so, in good truth, I am; and it seems a reason to him why you should not
      attach yourself to me, that I can claim no interest in the general herd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not suppose I forget what I owe him, for permitting me to shelter for
      four years under his roof: My obligations to him are not the less, but the
      greater, if he never heartily loved me. He is angry, too, that I will not,
      or cannot, be a lawyer, and, with reference to you, considers my
      disinclination that way as PESSIMI EXEMPLI, as he might say.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he need not be afraid that a lad of your steadiness will be influenced
      by such a reed shaken by the winds as I am. You will go on doubting with
      Dirleton, and resolving those doubts with Stewart, [&lsquo;Sir John Nisbett of
      Dirleton&rsquo;s DOUBTS AND QUESTIONS UPON THE LAW, ESPECIALLLY OF SCOTLAND;&rsquo; 
      and &lsquo;Sir James Stewart&rsquo;s DIRLETON&rsquo;S DOUBTS AND QUESTIONS ON THE LAW OF
      SCOTLAND RESOLVED AND ANSWERED,&rsquo; are works of authority in Scottish
      jurisprudence. As is generally the case, the doubts are held more in
      respect than the solution.] until the cramp speech [Till of late years,
      every advocate who catered at the Scottish bar made a Latin address to the
      Court, faculty, and audience, in set terms, and said a few words upon a
      text of the civil law, to show his Latinity and jurisprudence. He also
      wore his hat for a minute, in order to vindicate his right of being
      covered before the Court, which is said to have originated from the
      celebrated lawyer, Sir Thomas Hope, having two sons on the bench while he
      himself remained at the bar. Of late this ceremony has been dispensed
      with, as occupying the time of the Court unnecessarily. The entrant lawyer
      merely takes the oaths to government, and swears to maintain the rules and
      privileges of his order.] has been spoken more SOLITO from the corner of
      the bench, and with covered head&mdash;until you have sworn to defend the
      liberties and privileges of the College of Justice&mdash;until the black
      gown is hung on your shoulders, and you are free as any of the Faculty to
      sue or defend. Then will I step forth, Alan, and in a character which even
      your father will allow may be more useful to you than had I shared this
      splendid termination of your legal studies. In a word, if I cannot be a
      counsel, I am determined to be a CLIENT, a sort of person without whom a
      lawsuit would be as dull as a supposed case. Yes, I am determined to give
      you your first fee. One can easily, I am assured, get into a lawsuit&mdash;it
      is only the getting out which is sometimes found troublesome;&mdash;and,
      with your kind father for an agent, and you for my counsel learned in the
      law, and the worshipful Master Samuel Griffiths to back me, a few sessions
      shall not tire my patience. In short, I will make my way into court, even
      if it should cost me the committing a DELICT, or at least a QUASI DELICT.&mdash;You
      see all is not lost of what Erskine wrote, and Wallace taught.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far I have fooled it off well enough; and yet, Alan, all is not at
      ease within me. I am affected with a sense of loneliness, the more
      depressing, that it seems to me to be a solitude peculiarly my own. In a
      country where all the world have a circle of consanguinity, extending to
      sixth cousins at least, I am a solitary individual, having only one kind
      heart to throb in unison with my own. If I were condemned to labour for my
      bread, methinks I should less regard this peculiar species of deprivation,
      The necessary communication of master and servant would be at least a tie
      which would attach me to the rest of my kind&mdash;as it is, my very
      independence seems to enhance the peculiarity of my situation. I am in the
      world as a stranger in the crowded coffeehouse, where he enters, calls for
      what refreshment he wants, pays his bill, and is forgotten so soon as the
      waiter&rsquo;s mouth has pronounced his &lsquo;Thank ye, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I know your good father would term this SINNING MY MERCIES, [A peculiar
      Scottish phrase expressive of ingratitude for the favours of Providence.]
      and ask how I should feel if, instead of being able to throw down my
      reckoning, I were obliged to deprecate the resentment of the landlord for
      consuming that which I could not pay for. I cannot tell how it is; but,
      though this very reasonable reflection comes across me, and though I do
      confess that four hundred a year in possession, eight hundred in near
      prospect, and the L&mdash;d knows how many hundreds more in the distance,
      are very pretty and comfortable things, yet I would freely give one half
      of them to call your father father, though he should scold me for my
      idleness every hour of the day, and to call you brother, though a brother
      whose merits would throw my own so completely into the shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      The faint, yet not improbable, belief has often come across me, that your
      father knows something more about my birth and condition than he is
      willing to communicate; it is so unlikely that I should be left in
      Edinburgh at six years old, without any other recommendation than the
      regular payment of my board to old M&mdash;, [Probably Mathieson, the
      predecessor of Dr. Adams, to whose memory the author and his
      contemporaries owe a deep debt of gratitude.] of the High School. Before
      that time, as I have often told you, I have but a recollection of
      unbounded indulgence on my mother&rsquo;s part, and the most tyrannical exertion
      of caprice on my own. I remember still how bitterly she sighed, how vainly
      she strove to soothe me, while, in the full energy of despotism, I roared
      like ten bull-calves, for something which it was impossible to procure for
      me. She is dead, that kind, that ill-rewarded mother! I remember the long
      faces&mdash;the darkened rooms&mdash;the black hangings&mdash;the
      mysterious impression made upon my mind by the hearse and mourning
      coaches, and the difficulty which I had to reconcile all this to the
      disappearance of my mother. I do not think I had before this event formed,
      any idea, of death, or that I had even heard of that final consummation of
      all that lives. The first acquaintance which I formed with it deprived me
      of my only relation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A clergyman of venerable appearance, our only visitor, was my guide and
      companion in a journey of considerable length; and in the charge of
      another elderly man, substituted in his place, I know not how or why, I
      completed my journey to Scotland&mdash;and this is all I recollect.
    </p>
    <p>
      I repeat the little history now, as I have a hundred times before, merely
      because I would wring some sense out of it. Turn, then, thy sharp,
      wire-drawing, lawyer-like ingenuity to the same task&mdash;make up my
      history as though thou wert shaping the blundering allegations of some
      blue-bonneted, hard-headed client, into a condescendence of facts and
      circumstances, and thou shalt be, not my Apollo&mdash;QUID TIBI CUM LYRA?&mdash;but
      my Lord Stair, [Celebrated as a Scottish lawyer.] Meanwhile, I have
      written myself out of my melancholy and blue devils, merely by prosing
      about them; so I will now converse half an hour with Roan Robin in his
      stall&mdash;the rascal knows me already, and snickers whenever I cross the
      threshold of the stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The black which you bestrode yesterday morning promises to be an admirable
      roadster, and ambled as easily with Sam and the portmanteau, as with you
      and your load of law-learning. Sam promises to be steady, and has hitherto
      been so. No long trial, you will say. He lays the blame of former
      inaccuracies on evil company&mdash;the people who were at the
      livery-stable were too seductive, I suppose&mdash;he denies he ever did
      the horse injustice&mdash;would rather have wanted his own dinner, he
      says. In this I believe him, as Roan Robin&rsquo;s ribs and coat show no marks
      of contradiction. However, as he will meet with no saints in the inns we
      frequent, and as oats are sometimes as speedily converted into ale as John
      Barleycorn himself, I shall keep a look-out after Master Sam. Stupid
      fellow! had he not abused my good nature, I might have chatted to him to
      keep my tongue in exercise; whereas now I must keep him at a distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you remember what Mr. Fairford said to me on this subject&mdash;it did
      not become my father&rsquo;s son to speak in that manner to Sam&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s son?
      I asked you what your father could possibly know of mine; and you
      answered, &lsquo;As much, you supposed, as he knew of Sam&rsquo;s&mdash;it was a
      proverbial expression.&rsquo; This did not quite satisfy me; though I am sure I
      cannot tell why it should not. But I am returning to a fruitless and
      exhausted subject. Do not be afraid that I shall come back on this
      well-trodden yet pathless field of conjecture. I know nothing so useless,
      so utterly feeble and contemptible, as the groaning forth one&rsquo;s
      lamentations into the ears of our friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would fain promise you that my letters shall be as entertaining as I am
      determined they shall be regular and well filled. We have an advantage
      over the dear friends of old, every pair of them. Neither David and
      Jonathan, nor Orestes and Pylades, nor Damon and Pythias&mdash;although,
      in the latter case particularly, a letter by post would have been very
      acceptable&mdash;ever corresponded together; for they probably could not
      write, and certainly had neither post nor franks to speed their effusions
      to each other; whereas yours, which you had from the old peer, being
      handled gently, and opened with precaution, may be returned to me again,
      and serve to make us free of his Majesty&rsquo;s post office, during the whole
      time of my proposed tour. [It is well known and remembered, that when
      Members of Parliament enjoyed the unlimited privilege of franking by the
      mere writing the name on the cover, it was extended to the most
      extraordinary occasions. One noble lord, to express his regard for a
      particular regiment, franked a letter for every rank and file. It was
      customary also to save the covers and return them, in order that the
      correspondence might be carried on as long as the envelopes could hold
      together.] Mercy upon us, Alan! what letters I shall have to send to you,
      with an account of all that I can collect, of pleasant or rare, in this
      wild-goose jaunt of mine! All I stipulate is that you do not communicate
      them to the SCOTS MAGAZINE; for though you used, in a left-handed way, to
      compliment me on my attainments in the lighter branches of literature, at
      the expense of my deficiency in the weightier matters of the law, I am not
      yet audacious enough to enter the portal which the learned Ruddiman so
      kindly opened for the acolytes of the Muses.&mdash;VALE SIS MEMOR MEI. D.

      LETTER II
    </h2>
    <h3>
      ALAN FAIRFORD TO DARSIE LATIMER
    </h3>
    <p>
      NEGATUR, my dear Darsie&mdash;you have logic and law enough to understand
      the word of denial. I deny your conclusion. The premises I admit, namely,
      that when I mounted on that infernal hack, I might utter what seemed a
      sigh, although I deemed it lost amid the puffs and groans of the
      broken-winded brute, matchless in the complication of her complaints by
      any save she, the poor man&rsquo;s mare, renowned in song, that died
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  A mile aboon Dundee.

 [Alluding, as all Scotsmen know, to the humorous old song:&mdash;

 &lsquo;The auld man&rsquo;s mare&rsquo;s dead,
  The puir man&rsquo;s mare&rsquo;s dead,
  The auld man&rsquo;s mare&rsquo;s dead,
  A mile aboon Dundee.&lsquo;]
</pre>
    <p>
      But credit me, Darsie, the sigh which escaped me, concerned thee more than
      myself, and regarded neither the superior mettle of your cavalry, nor your
      greater command of the means of travelling. I could certainly have
      cheerfully ridden with you for a few days; and assure yourself I would not
      have hesitated to tax your better filled purse for our joint expenses. But
      you know my father considers every moment taken from the law as a step
      down hill; and I owe much to his anxiety on my account, although its
      effects are sometimes troublesome. For example:
    </p>
    <p>
      I found, on my arrival at the shop in Brown&rsquo;s Square, that the old
      gentleman had returned that very evening, impatient, it seems, of
      remaining a night out of the guardianship of the domestic Lares. Having
      this information from James, whose brow wore rather an anxious look on the
      occasion, I dispatched a Highland chairman to the livery stable with my
      Bucephalus, and slunk, with as little noise as might be, into my own den,
      where I began to mumble certain half-gnawed and not half-digested
      doctrines of our municipal code. I was not long seated, when my father&rsquo;s
      visage was thrust, in a peering sort of way, through the half-opened door;
      and withdrawn, on seeing my occupation, with a half-articulated HUMPH!
      which seemed to convey a doubt of the seriousness of my application. If it
      were so, I cannot condemn him; for recollection of thee occupied me so
      entirely during an hour&rsquo;s reading, that although Stair lay before me, and
      notwithstanding that I turned over three or four pages, the sense of his
      lordship&rsquo;s clear and perspicuous style so far escaped me, that I had the
      mortification to find my labour was utterly in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ere I had brought up my lee-way, James appeared with his summons to our
      frugal supper&mdash;radishes, cheese, and a bottle of the old ale-only two
      plates though&mdash;and no chair set for Mr. Darsie, by the attentive
      James Wilkinson. Said James, with his long face, lank hair, and very long
      pig-tail in its leathern strap, was placed, as usual, at the back of my
      father&rsquo;s chair, upright as a wooden sentinel at the door of a puppet-show.
      &lsquo;You may go down, James,&rsquo; said my father; and exit Wilkinson.&mdash;What
      is to come next? thought I; for the weather is not clear on the paternal
      brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      My boots encountered his first glance of displeasure, and he asked me,
      with a sneer, which way I had been riding. He expected me to answer,
      &lsquo;Nowhere,&rsquo; and would then have been at me with his usual sarcasm, touching
      the humour of walking in shoes at twenty shillings a pair. But I answered
      with composure, that I had ridden out to dinner as far as Noble House. He
      started (you know his way) as if I had said that I had dined at Jericho;
      and as I did not choose to seem to observe his surprise, but continued
      munching my radishes in tranquillity, he broke forth in ire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To Noble House, sir! and what had you to do at Noble House, sir? Do you
      remember you are studying law, sir?&mdash;that your Scots law trials are
      coming on, sir?&mdash;that every moment of your time just now is worth
      hours at another time?&mdash;and have you leisure to go to Noble House,
      sir?&mdash;and to throw your books behind you for so many hours?&mdash;Had
      it been a turn in the meadows, or even a game at golf&mdash;but Noble
      House, sir!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I went so far with Darsie Latimer, sir, to see him begin his journey.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Darsie Latimer?&rsquo; he replied in a softened tone&mdash;&lsquo;Humph!&mdash;Well,
      I do not blame you for being kind to Darsie Latimer; but it would have
      done as much good if you had walked with him as far as the toll-bar, and
      then made your farewells&mdash;it would have saved horse-hire&mdash;and
      your reckoning, too, at dinner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Latimer paid that, sir,&rsquo; I replied, thinking to soften the matter; but I
      had much better have left it unspoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The reckoning, sir!&rsquo; replied my father. &lsquo;And did you sponge upon any man
      for a reckoning? Sir, no man should enter the door of a public-house
      without paying his lawing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I admit the general rule, sir,&rsquo; I replied; &lsquo;but this was a parting-cup
      between Darsie and me; and I should conceive it fell under the exception
      of DOCH AN DORROCH.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You think yourself a wit,&rsquo; said my father, with as near an approach to a
      smile as ever he permits to gild the solemnity of his features; &lsquo;but I
      reckon you did not eat your dinner standing, like the Jews at their
      Passover? and it was decided in a case before the town-bailies of
      Cupar-Angus, when Luckie Simpson&rsquo;s cow had drunk up Luckie Jamieson&rsquo;s
      browst of ale while it stood in the door to cool, that there was no damage
      to pay, because the crummie drank without sitting down; such being the
      very circumstance constituting DOCH AN DORROCH, which is a standing drink,
      for which no reckoning is paid. Ha, sir! what says your advocateship
      (FIERI) to that? EXEPTIO FIRMAT REGULAM&mdash;But come, fill your glass,
      Alan; I am not sorry ye have shown this attention to Darsie Latimer, who
      is a good lad, as times go; and having now lived under my roof since he
      left the school, why, there is really no great matter in coming under this
      small obligation to him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As I saw my father&rsquo;s scruples were much softened by the consciousness of
      his superiority in the legal argument, I took care to accept my pardon as
      a matter of grace, rather than of justice; and only replied, we should
      feel ourselves duller of an evening, now that you were absent. I will give
      you my father&rsquo;s exact words in reply, Darsie. You know him so well, that
      they will not offend you; and you are also aware, that there mingles with
      the good man&rsquo;s preciseness and formality, a fund of shrewd observation and
      practical good sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is very true,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;Darsie was a pleasant companion-but over
      waggish, over waggish, Alan, and somewhat scatter-brained.&mdash;By the
      way, Wilkinson must get our ale bottled in English pints now, for a quart
      bottle is too much, night after night, for you and me, without his
      assistance.&mdash;But Darsie, as I was saying, is an arch lad, and
      somewhat light in the upper story&mdash;I wish him well through the world;
      but he has little solidity, Alan, little solidity.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I scorn to desert an absent friend, Darsie, so I said for you a little
      more than my conscience warranted: but your defection from your legal
      studies had driven you far to leeward in my father&rsquo;s good opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Unstable as water, he shall not excel,&rsquo; said my father; &lsquo;or, as the
      Septuagint hath it, EFUSA EST SICUT AQUA&mdash;NON CRESCAT. He goeth to
      dancing-houses, and readeth novels&mdash;SAT EST.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I endeavoured to parry these texts by observing, that the dancing-houses
      amounted only to one night at La Pique&rsquo;s ball&mdash;the novels (so far as
      matter of notoriety, Darsie) to an odd volume of TOM JONES.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But he danced from night to morning,&rsquo; replied my father, &lsquo;and he read the
      idle trash, which the author should have been scourged for, at least
      twenty times over. It was never out of his hand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I then hinted, that in all probability your fortune was now so easy as to
      dispense with your prosecuting the law any further than you had done; and
      therefore you might think you had some title to amuse yourself. This was
      the least palatable argument of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If he cannot amuse himself with the law,&rsquo; said my father, snappishly &lsquo;it
      is the worse for him. If he needs not law to teach him to make a fortune,
      I am sure he needs it to teach him how to keep one; and it would better
      become him to be learning this, than to be scouring the country like a
      land-louper, going he knows not where, to see he knows not what, and
      giving treats at Noble House to fools like himself&rsquo; (an angry glance at
      poor me), &lsquo;Noble House, indeed!&rsquo; he repeated, with elevated voice and
      sneering tone, as if there were something offensive to him in the name,
      though I will venture to say that any place in which you had been
      extravagant enough to spend five shillings, would have stood as deep in
      his reprobation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mindful of your idea, that my father knows more of your real situation
      than he thinks proper to mention, I thought I would hazard a fishing
      observation. &lsquo;I did not see,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;how the Scottish law would be
      useful to a young gentleman whose fortune would seem to be vested in
      England.&rsquo;&mdash;I really thought my father would have beat me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;D&rsquo;ye mean to come round me, sir, PER AMBAGES, as Counsellor Pest says?
      What is it to you where Darsie Latimer&rsquo;s fortune is vested, or whether he
      hath any fortune, aye or no? And what ill would the Scottish law do to
      him, though he had as much of it as either Stair or Bankton, sir? Is not
      the foundation of our municipal law the ancient code of the Roman Empire,
      devised at a time when it was so much renowned for its civil polity, sir,
      and wisdom? Go to your bed, sir, after your expedition to Noble House, and
      see that your lamp be burning and your book before you ere the sun peeps.
      ARS LONGA, VITA BREVIS&mdash;were it not a sin to call the divine science
      of the law by the inferior name of art.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So my lamp did burn, dear Darsie, the next morning, though the owner took
      the risk of a domiciliary visitation, and lay snug in bed, trusting its
      glimmer might, without further inquiry, be received as sufficient evidence
      of his vigilance. And now, upon this the third morning after your
      departure, things are but little better; for though the lamp burns in my
      den, and VOET ON THE PANDECTS hath his wisdom spread open before me, yet
      as I only use him as a reading-desk on which to scribble this sheet of
      nonsense to Darsie Latimer, it is probable the vicinity will be of little
      furtherance to my studies.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, methinks, I hear thee call me an affected hypocritical varlet,
      who, living under such a system of distrust and restraint as my father
      chooses to govern by, nevertheless pretends not to envy you your freedom
      and independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Latimer, I will tell you no lies. I wish my father would allow me a little
      more exercise of my free will, were it but that I might feel the pleasure
      of doing what would please him of my own accord. A little more spare time,
      and a little more money to enjoy it, would, besides, neither misbecome my
      age nor my condition; and it is, I own, provoking to see so many in the
      same situation winging the air at freedom, while I sit here, caged up like
      a cobbler&rsquo;s linnet, to chant the same unvaried lesson from sunrise to
      sunset, not to mention the listening to so many lectures against idleness,
      as if I enjoyed or was making use of the means of amusement! But then I
      cannot at heart blame either the motive or the object of this severity.
      For the motive, it is and can only be my father&rsquo;s anxious, devoted, and
      unremitting affection and zeal for my improvement, with a laudable sense
      of the honour of the profession to which he has trained me.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we have no near relations, the tie betwixt us is of even unusual
      closeness, though in itself one of the strongest which nature can form. I
      am, and have all along been, the exclusive object of my father&rsquo;s anxious
      hopes, and his still more anxious and engrossing fears; so what title have
      I to complain, although now and then these fears and hopes lead him to
      take a troublesome and incessant charge of all my motions? Besides, I
      ought to recollect, and, Darsie, I do recollect, that my father upon
      various occasions, has shown that he can be indulgent as well as strict.
      The leaving his old apartments in the Luckenbooths was to him like
      divorcing the soul from the body; yet Dr. R&mdash;&mdash; did but hint
      that the better air of this new district was more favourable to my health,
      as I was then suffering under the penalties of too rapid a growth, when he
      exchanged his old and beloved quarters, adjacent to the very Heart of
      Midlothian, for one of those new tenements (entire within themselves)
      which modern taste has so lately introduced. Instance also the inestimable
      favour which he conferred on me by receiving you into his house, when you
      had only the unpleasant alternative of remaining, though a grown-up lad,
      in the society of mere boys. [The diminutive and obscure place called
      Brown&rsquo;s Square, was hailed about the time of its erection as an extremely
      elegant improvement upon the style of designing and erecting Edinburgh
      residences. Each house was, in the phrase used by appraisers, &lsquo;finished
      within itself,&rsquo; or, in the still newer phraseology, &lsquo;self-contained.&rsquo; It
      was built about the year 1763-4; and the old part of the city being near
      and accessible, this square soon received many inhabitants, who ventured
      to remove to so moderate a distance from the High Street.] This was a
      thing so contrary to all my father&rsquo;s ideas of seclusion, of economy, and
      of the safety to my morals and industry, which he wished to attain, by
      preserving me from the society of other young people, that, upon my word,
      I am always rather astonished how I should have had the impudence to make
      the request, than that he should have complied with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then for the object of his solicitude&mdash;Do not laugh, or hold up your
      hands, my good Darsie; but upon my word I like the profession to which I
      am in the course of being educated, and am serious in prosecuting the
      preliminary studies. The law is my vocation&mdash;in an especial, and, I
      may say, in an hereditary way, my vocation; for although I have not the
      honour to belong to any of the great families who form in Scotland, as in
      France, the noblesse of the robe, and with us, at least, carry their heads
      as high, or rather higher, than the noblesse of the sword,&mdash;for the
      former consist more frequently of the &lsquo;first-born of Egypt,&rsquo;&mdash;yet my
      grandfather, who, I dare say, was a most excellent person, had the honour
      to sign a bitter protest against the Union, in the respectable character
      of town-clerk to the ancient Borough of Birlthegroat; and there is some
      reason&mdash;shall I say to hope, or to suspect?&mdash;that he may have
      been a natural son of a first cousin of the then Fairford of that Ilk, who
      had been long numbered among the minor barons. Now my father mounted a
      step higher on the ladder of legal promotion, being, as you know as well
      as I do, an eminent and respected Writer to his Majesty&rsquo;s Signet; and I
      myself am destined to mount a round higher still, and wear the honoured
      robe which is sometimes supposed, like Charity, to cover a multitude of
      sins. I have, therefore, no choice but to climb upwards; since we have
      mounted thus high, or else to fall down at the imminent risk of my neck.
      So that I reconcile myself to my destiny; and while you, are looking from
      mountain peaks, at distant lakes and firths, I am, DE APICIBUS JURIS,
      consoling myself with visions of crimson and scarlet gowns&mdash;with the
      appendages of handsome cowls, well lined with salary.
    </p>
    <p>
      You smile, Darsie, MORE TUO, and seem to say it is little worth while to
      cozen one&rsquo;s self with such vulgar dreams; yours being, on the contrary, of
      a high and heroic character, bearing the same resemblance to mine, that a
      bench, covered with purple cloth and plentifully loaded with session
      papers, does to some Gothic throne, rough with barbaric pearl and gold.
      But what would you have?&mdash;SUA QUEMQUE TRAHIT VOLUPTAS. And my visions
      of preferment, though they may be as unsubstantial at present, are
      nevertheless more capable of being realized, than your aspirations after
      the Lord knows what. What says my father&rsquo;s proverb? &lsquo;Look to a gown of
      gold, and you will at least get a sleeve of it.&rsquo; Such is my pursuit; but
      what dost thou look to? The chance that the mystery, as you call it, which
      at present overclouds your birth and connexions, will clear up into
      something inexpressibly and inconceivably brilliant; and this without any
      effort or exertion of your own, but purely by the goodwill of Fortune. I
      know the pride and naughtiness of thy heart, and sincerely do I wish that
      thou hadst more beatings to thank me for, than those which thou dost
      acknowledge so gratefully. Then had I thumped these Quixotical
      expectations out of thee, and thou hadst not, as now, conceived thyself to
      be the hero of some romantic history, and converted, in thy vain
      imaginations, honest Griffiths, citizen and broker, who never bestows more
      than the needful upon his quarterly epistles, into some wise Alexander or
      sage Alquife, the mystical and magical protector of thy peerless destiny.
      But I know not how it was, thy skull got harder, I think, and my knuckles
      became softer; not to mention that at length thou didst begin to show
      about thee a spark of something dangerous, which I was bound to respect at
      least, if I did not fear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And while I speak of this, it is not much amiss to advise thee to correct
      a little this cock-a-hoop courage of thine. I fear much that, like a
      hot-mettled horse, it will carry the owner into some scrape, out of which
      he will find it difficult to extricate himself, especially if the daring
      spirit which bore thee thither should chance to fail thee at a pinch.
      Remember, Darsie, thou art not naturally courageous; on the contrary, we
      have long since agreed that, quiet as I am, I have the advantage in this
      important particular. My courage consists, I think, in strength of nerves
      and constitutional indifference to danger; which, though it never pushes
      me on adventure, secures me in full use of my recollection, and tolerably
      complete self-possession, when danger actually arrives. Now, thine seems
      more what may be called intellectual courage; highness of spirit, and
      desire of distinction; impulses which render thee alive to the love of
      fame, and deaf to the apprehension of danger, until it forces itself
      suddenly upon thee. I own that, whether it is from my having caught my
      father&rsquo;s apprehensions, or that I have reason to entertain doubts of my
      own, I often think that this wildfire chase of romantic situation and
      adventure may lead thee into some mischief; and then what would become of
      Alan Fairford? They might make whom they pleased Lord Advocate or
      Solicitor-General, I should never have the heart to strive for it. All my
      exertions are intended to Vindicate myself one day in your eyes; and I
      think I should not care a farthing for the embroidered silk gown, more
      than for an old woman&rsquo;s apron, unless I had hopes that thou shouldst be
      walking the boards to admire, and perhaps to envy me.
    </p>
    <p>
      That this may be the case, I prithee&mdash;beware! See not a Dulcinea, in
      every slipshod girl, who, with blue eyes, fair hair, a tattered plaid, and
      a willow-wand in her grip, drives out the village cows to the loaning. Do
      not think you will meet a gallant Valentine in every English rider, or an
      Orson in every Highland drover. View things as they are, and not as they
      may be magnified through thy teeming fancy. I have seen thee look at an
      old gravel pit, till thou madest out capes, and bays, and inlets, crags
      and precipices, and the whole stupendous scenery of the Isle of Feroe, in
      what was, to all ordinary eyes, a mere horse-pond. Besides, did I not once
      find thee gazing with respect at a lizard, in the attitude of one who
      looks upon a crocodile? Now this is, doubtless, so far a harmless exercise
      of your imagination; for the puddle cannot drown you, nor the Lilliputian
      alligator eat you up. But it is different in society, where you cannot
      mistake the character of those you converse with, or suffer your fancy to
      exaggerate their qualities, good or bad, without exposing yourself not
      only to ridicule, but to great and serious inconveniences. Keep guard,
      therefore, on your imagination, my dear Darsie; and let your old friend
      assure you, it is the point of your character most pregnant with peril to
      its good and generous owner. Adieu! let not the franks of the worthy peer
      remain unemployed; above all, SIS MEMOR MEI. A. F.

      LETTER III

    <h3>
      DARSIE LATIMER TO ALAN FAIRFORD
    </h3>
    <p>
      SHEPHERD&rsquo;S BUSH.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have received thine absurd and most conceited epistle. It is well for
      thee that, Lovelace and Belford-like, we came under a convention to pardon
      every species of liberty which we may take with each other; since, upon my
      word, there are some reflections in your last which would otherwise have
      obliged me to return forthwith to Edinburgh, merely to show you I was not
      what you took me for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, what a pair of prigs hast thou made of us! I plunging into scrapes,
      without having courage to get out of them&mdash;thy sagacious self, afraid
      to put one foot before the other, lest it should run away from its
      companion; and so standing still like a post, out of mere faintness and
      coldness of heart, while all the world were driving full speed past thee.
      Thou a portrait-painter! I tell thee, Alan, I have seen a better seated on
      the fourth round of a ladder, and painting a bare-breeched Highlander,
      holding a pint-stoup as big as himself, and a booted Lowlander, in a
      bobwig, supporting a glass of like dimensions; the whole being designed to
      represent the sign of the Salutation.
    </p>
    <p>
      How hadst thou the heart to represent thine own individual self, with all
      thy motions, like those of a great Dutch doll, depending on the pressure
      of certain springs, as duty, reflection, and the like; without the impulse
      of which, thou wouldst doubtless have me believe thou wouldst not budge an
      inch! But have I not seen Gravity out of his bed at midnight? and must I,
      in plain terms, remind thee of certain mad pranks? Thou hadst ever, with
      the gravest sentiments in thy mouth and the most starched reserve in thy
      manner, a kind of lumbering proclivity towards mischief, although with
      more inclination to set it a-going than address to carry it through; and I
      cannot but chuckle internally, when I think of having seen my most
      venerable monitor, the future president of some high Scottish court,
      puffing, blowing, and floundering, like a clumsy cart-horse in a bog where
      his efforts to extricate himself only plunged him deeper at every awkward
      struggle, till some one&mdash;I myself, for example&mdash;took compassion
      on the moaning monster, and dragged him out by mane and tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for me, my portrait is, if possible, even more scandalously
      caricatured, I fail or quail in spirit at the upcome! Where canst thou
      show me the least symptom of the recreant temper, with which thou hast
      invested me (as I trust) merely to set off the solid and impassible
      dignity of thine own stupid indifference? If you ever saw me tremble, be
      assured that my flesh, like that of the old Spanish general, only quaked
      at the dangers into which my spirit was about to lead it. Seriously, Alan,
      this imputed poverty of spirit is a shabby charge to bring against your
      friend. I have examined myself as closely as I can, being, in very truth,
      a little hurt at your having such hard thoughts of me, and on my life I
      can see no reason for them. I allow you have, perhaps, some advantage of
      me in the steadiness and indifference of your temper; but I should despise
      myself, if I were conscious of the deficiency in courage which you seem
      willing enough to impute to me. However, I suppose, this ungracious hint
      proceeds from sincere anxiety for my safety; and so viewing it, I swallow
      it as I would do medicine from a friendly doctor, although I believed in
      my heart he had mistaken my complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
      This offensive insinuation disposed of, I thank thee, Alan, for the rest
      of thy epistle. I thought I heard your good father pronouncing the word
      Noble House, with a mixture of contempt and displeasure, as if the very
      name of the poor little hamlet were odious to him, or as if you had
      selected, out of all Scotland, the very place at which you had no call to
      dine. But if he had had any particular aversion to that blameless village
      and very sorry inn, is it not his own fault that I did not accept the
      invitation of the Laird of Glengallacher, to shoot a buck in what he
      emphatically calls &lsquo;his country&rsquo;? Truth is, I had a strong desire to have
      complied with his lairdship&rsquo;s invitation. To shoot a buck! Think how
      magnificent an idea to one who never shot anything but hedge-sparrows, and
      that with a horse-pistol purchased at a broker&rsquo;s stand in the Cowgate!
      You, who stand upon your courage, may remember that I took the risk of
      firing the said pistol for the first time, while you stood at twenty
      yards&rsquo; distance; and that, when you were persuaded it would go off without
      bursting, forgetting all law but that of the biggest and strongest, you
      possessed yourself of it exclusively for the rest of the holidays. Such a
      day&rsquo;s sport was no complete introduction to the noble art of
      deer-stalking, as it is practised in the Highlands; but I should not have
      scrupled to accept honest Glengallacher&rsquo;s invitation, at the risk of
      firing a rifle for the first time, had it not been for the outcry which
      your father made at my proposal, in the full ardour of his zeal for King
      George, the Hanover succession, and the Presbyterian faith. I wish I had
      stood out, since I have gained so little upon his good opinion by
      submission. All his impressions concerning the Highlanders are taken from
      the recollections of the Forty-five, when he retreated from the West Port
      with his brother volunteers, each to the fortalice of his own separate
      dwelling, so soon as they heard the Adventurer was arrived with his clans
      as near them as Kirkliston. The flight of Falkirk&mdash;PARMA NON BENE
      SELECTA&mdash;in which I think your sire had his share with the undaunted
      western regiment, does not seem to have improved his taste for the company
      of the Highlanders; (quaere, Alan, dost thou derive the courage thou
      makest such boast of from an hereditary source?) and stories of Rob Roy
      Macgregor, and Sergeant Alan Mhor Cameron, have served to paint them in
      still more sable colours to his imagination. [Of Rob Roy we have had more
      than enough. Alan Cameron, commonly called Sergeant Mhor, a freebooter of
      the same period, was equally remarkable for strength, courage, and
      generosity.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, from all I can understand, these ideas, as applied to the present
      state of the country, are absolutely chimerical. The Pretender is no more
      remembered in the Highlands than if the poor gentleman were gathered to
      his hundred and eight fathers, whose portraits adorn the ancient walls of
      Holyrood; the broadswords have passed into other hands; the targets are
      used to cover the butter churns; and the race has sunk, or is fast
      sinking, from ruffling bullies into tame cheaters. Indeed, it was partly
      my conviction that there is little to be seen in the north, which,
      arriving at your father&rsquo;s conclusions, though from different premisses,
      inclined my course in this direction, where perhaps I shall see as little.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing, however, I HAVE seen; and it was with pleasure the more
      indescribable, that I was debarred from treading the land which my eyes
      were permitted to gaze upon, like those of the dying prophet from top of
      Mount Pisgah,&mdash;I have seen, in a word, the fruitful shores of merry
      England; merry England! of which I boast myself a native, and on which I
      gaze, even while raging floods and unstable quicksands divide us, with the
      filial affection of a dutiful son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thou canst not have forgotten, Alan&mdash;for when didst thou ever forget
      what was interesting to thy friend?&mdash;that the same letter from my
      friend Griffiths, which doubled my income, and placed my motions at my own
      free disposal, contained a prohibitory clause, by which, reason none
      assigned, I was prohibited, as I respected my present safety and future
      fortunes, from visiting England; every other part of the British
      dominions, and a tour, if I pleased, on the Continent, being left to my
      own choice.&mdash;Where is the tale, Alan, of a covered dish in the midst
      of a royal banquet, upon which the eyes of every guest were immediately
      fixed, neglecting all the dainties with which the table was loaded? This
      cause of banishment from England&mdash;from my native country&mdash;from
      the land of the brave, and the wise, and the free&mdash;affects me more
      than I am rejoiced by the freedom and independence assigned to me in all
      other respects. Thus, in seeking this extreme boundary of the country
      which I am forbidden to tread, I resemble the poor tethered horse, which,
      you may have observed, is always grazing on the very verge of the circle
      to which it is limited by its halter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not accuse me of romance for obeying this impulse towards the South;
      nor suppose that, to satisfy the imaginary longing of an idle curiosity, I
      am in any danger of risking the solid comforts of my present condition.
      Whoever has hitherto taken charge of my motions has shown me, by
      convincing proofs more weighty than the assurances which they have
      witheld, that my real advantage is their principal object. I should be,
      therefore, worse than a fool did I object to their authority, even when it
      seems somewhat capriciously exercised; for assuredly, at my age, I might&mdash;intrusted
      as I am with the care and management of myself in every other particular&mdash;expect
      that the cause of excluding me from England should be frankly and fairly
      stated for my own consideration and guidance. However, I will not grumble
      about the matter. I shall know the whole story one day, I suppose; and
      perhaps, as you sometimes surmise, I shall not find there is any mighty
      matter in it after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet one cannot help wondering&mdash;but plague on it, if I wonder any
      longer, my letter will be as full of wonders as one of Katterfelto&rsquo;s
      advertisements. I have a month&rsquo;s mind, instead of this damnable iteration
      of guesses and forebodings, to give thee the history of a little adventure
      which befell me yesterday; though I am sure you will, as usual, turn the
      opposite side of the spyglass on my poor narrative, and reduce, MORE TUO,
      to the most petty trivialities, the circumstance to which thou accusest me
      of giving undue consequence. Hang thee, Alan, thou art as unfit a
      confidant for a youthful gallant with some spice of imagination, as the
      old taciturn secretary of Facardin of Trebizond. Nevertheless, we must
      each perform our separate destinies. I am doomed to see, act, and tell;
      thou, like a Dutchman enclosed in the same diligence with a Gascon, to
      hear, and shrug thy shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Dumfries, the capital town of this county, I have but little to say,
      and will not abuse your patience by reminding you that it is built on the
      gallant river Nith, and that its churchyard, the highest place of the old
      town, commands an extensive and fine prospect. Neither will I take the
      traveller&rsquo;s privilege of inflicting upon you the whole history of Bruce
      poniarding the Red Comyn in the Church of the Dominicans at this place,
      and becoming a king and patriot because he had been a church-breaker and a
      murderer. The present Dumfriezers remember and justify the deed, observing
      it was only a papist church&mdash;in evidence whereof, its walls have been
      so completely demolished that no vestiges of them remain. They are a
      sturdy set of true-blue Presbyterians, these burghers of Dumfries; men
      after your father&rsquo;s own heart, zealous for the Protestant succession&mdash;the
      rather that many of the great families around are suspected to be of a
      different way of thinking, and shared, a great many of them, in the
      insurrection of the Fifteen, and some in the more recent business of the
      Forty-five. The town itself suffered in the latter era; for Lord Elcho,
      with a large party of the rebels, levied a severe contribution upon
      Dumfries, on account of the citizens having annoyed the rear of the
      Chevalier during his march into England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of these particulars I learned from Provost C&mdash;, who, happening
      to see me in the market-place, remembered that I was an intimate of your
      father&rsquo;s, and very kindly asked me to dinner. Pray tell your father that
      the effects of his kindness to me follow me everywhere. I became tired,
      however, of this pretty town in the course of twenty-four hours, and crept
      along the coast eastwards, amusing myself with looking out for objects of
      antiquity, and sometimes making, or attempting to make, use of my new
      angling-rod. By the way, old Cotton&rsquo;s instructions, by which I hoped to
      qualify myself for one of the gentle society of anglers, are not worth a
      farthing for this meridian. I learned this by mere accident, after I had
      waited four mortal hours. I shall never forget an impudent urchin, a
      cowherd, about twelve years old, without either brogue or bonnet,
      barelegged, and with a very indifferent pair of breeches&mdash;how the
      villain grinned in scorn at my landing-net, my plummet, and the gorgeous
      jury of flies which I had assembled to destroy all the fish in the river.
      I was induced at last to lend the rod to the sneering scoundrel, to see
      what he would make of it; and he had not only half filled my basket in an
      hour, but literally taught me to kill two trouts with my own hand. This,
      and Sam having found the hay and oats, not forgetting the ale, very good
      at this small inn, first made me take the fancy of resting here for a day
      or two; and I have got my grinning blackguard of a piscator leave to
      attend on me, by paying sixpence a day for a herd-boy in his stead.
    </p>
    <p>
      A notably clean Englishwoman keeps this small house, and my bedroom is
      sweetened with lavender, has a clean sash-window, and the walls are,
      moreover, adorned with ballads of Fair Rosamond and Cruel Barbara Allan.
      The woman&rsquo;s accent, though uncouth enough, sounds yet kindly in my ear;
      for I have never yet forgotten the desolate effect produced on my infant
      organs, when I heard on all sides your slow and broad northern
      pronunciation, which was to me the tone of a foreign land. I am sensible I
      myself have since that time acquired Scotch in perfection, and many a
      Scotticism withal. Still the sound of the English accentuation comes to my
      ears as the tones of a friend; and even when heard from the mouth of some
      wandering beggar, it has seldom failed to charm forth my mite. You Scotch,
      who are so proud of your own nationality, must make due allowance for that
      of other folks.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the next morning I was about to set forth to the stream where I had
      commenced angler the night before, but was prevented by a heavy shower of
      rain from stirring abroad the whole forenoon; during all which time, I
      heard my varlet of a guide as loud with his blackguard jokes in the
      kitchen, as a footman in the shilling gallery; so little are modesty and
      innocence the inseparable companions of rusticity and seclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      When after dinner the day cleared, and we at length sallied out to the
      river side, I found myself subjected to a new trick on the part of my
      accomplished preceptor. Apparently, he liked fishing himself better than
      the trouble of instructing an awkward novice such as I; and in hopes of
      exhausting my patience, and inducing me to resign the rod, as I had done
      the preceding day, my friend contrived to keep me thrashing the water more
      than an hour with a pointless hook. I detected this trick at last, by
      observing the rogue grinning with delight when he saw a large trout rise
      and dash harmless away from the angle. I gave him a sound cuff, Alan; but
      the next moment was sorry, and, to make amends, yielded possession of the
      fishing-rod for the rest of the evening, he undertaking to bring me home a
      dish of trouts for my supper, in atonement for his offences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thus got honourably rid of the trouble of amusing myself in a way I
      cared not for, I turned my steps towards the sea, or rather the Solway
      Firth which here separates the two sister kingdoms, and which lay at about
      a mile&rsquo;s distance, by a pleasant walk over sandy knells, covered with
      short herbage, which you call Links, and we English, Downs.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the rest of my adventure would weary out my fingers, and must be
      deferred until to-morrow, when you shall hear from me, by way of
      continuation; and, in the meanwhile, to prevent over-hasty conclusions, I
      must just hint to you, we are but yet on the verge of the adventure which
      it is my purpose to communicate.

    <h2>
      LETTER IV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE SAME TO THE SAME
    </h3>
    <p>
      SHEPHERD&rsquo;S BUSH.
    </p>
    <p>
      I mentioned in my last, that having abandoned my fishing-rod as an
      unprofitable implement, I crossed over the open downs which divided me
      from the margin of the Solway. When I reached the banks of the great
      estuary, which are here very bare and exposed, the waters had receded from
      the large and level space of sand, through which a stream, now feeble and
      fordable, found its way to the ocean. The whole was illuminated by the
      beams of the low and setting sun, who showed his ruddy front, like a
      warrior prepared for defence, over a huge battlemented and turreted wall
      of crimson and black clouds, which appeared like an immense Gothic
      fortress, into which the lord of day was descending. His setting rays
      glimmered bright upon the wet surface of the sands, and the numberless
      pools of water by which it was covered, where the inequality of the ground
      had occasioned their being left by the tide.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene was animated by the exertions of a number of horsemen, who were
      actually employed in hunting salmon. Aye, Alan, lift up your hands and
      eyes as you will, I can give their mode of fishing no name so appropriate;
      for they chased the fish at full gallop, and struck them with their barbed
      spears, as you see hunters spearing boars in the old tapestry. The salmon,
      to be sure, take the thing more quietly than the boars; but they are so
      swift in their own element, that to pursue and strike them is the task of
      a good horseman, with a quick eye, a determined hand, and full command
      both of his horse and weapon. The shouts of the fellows as they galloped
      up and down in the animating exercise&mdash;their loud bursts of laughter
      when any of their number caught a fall&mdash;and still louder acclamations
      when any of the party made a capital stroke with his lance&mdash;gave so
      much animation to the whole scene, that I caught the enthusiasm of the
      sport, and ventured forward a considerable space on the sands. The feats
      of one horseman, in particular, called forth so repeatedly the clamorous
      applause of his companions, that the very banks rang again with their
      shouts. He was a tall man, well mounted on a strong black horse, which he
      caused to turn and wind like a bird in the air, carried a longer spear
      than the others, and wore a sort of fur cap or bonnet, with a short
      feather in it, which gave him on the whole rather a superior appearance to
      the other fishermen. He seemed to hold some sort of authority among them,
      and occasionally directed their motions both by voice and hand: at which
      times I thought his gestures were striking, and his voice uncommonly
      sonorous and commanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The riders began to make for the shore, and the interest of the scene was
      almost over, while I lingered on the sands, with my looks turned to the
      shores of England, still gilded by the sun&rsquo;s last rays, and, as it seemed,
      scarce distant a mile from me. The anxious thoughts which haunt me began
      to muster in my bosom, and my feet slowly and insensibly approached the
      river which divided me from the forbidden precincts, though without any
      formed intention, when my steps were arrested by the sound of a horse
      galloping; and as I turned, the rider (the same fisherman whom I had
      formerly distinguished) called out to me, in an abrupt manner, &lsquo;Soho,
      brother! you are too late for Bowness to-night&mdash;the tide will make
      presently.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned my head and looked at him without answering; for, to my thinking,
      his sudden appearance (or rather, I should say, his unexpected approach)
      had, amidst the gathering shadows and lingering light, something in it
      which was wild and ominous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you deaf?&rsquo; he added&mdash;&lsquo;or are you mad?&mdash;or have you a mind
      for the next world?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am a stranger,&rsquo; I answered,&rsquo; and had no other purpose than looking on
      at the fishing&mdash;I am about to return to the side I came from.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Best make haste then,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;He that dreams on the bed of the Solway,
      may wake in the next world. The sky threatens a blast that will bring in
      the waves three feet abreast.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he turned his horse and rode off, while I began to walk back
      towards the Scottish shore, a little alarmed at what I had heard; for the
      tide advances with such rapidity upon these fatal sands, that well-mounted
      horsemen lay aside hopes of safety, if they see its white surge advancing
      while they are yet at a distance from the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      These recollections grew more agitating, and, instead of walking
      deliberately, I began a race as fast as I could, feeling, or thinking I
      felt, each pool of salt water through which I splashed, grow deeper and
      deeper. At length the surface of the sand did seem considerably more
      intersected with pools and channels full of water&mdash;either that the
      tide was really beginning to influence the bed of the estuary, or, as I
      must own is equally probable, that I had, in the hurry and confusion of my
      retreat, involved myself in difficulties which I had avoided in my more
      deliberate advance. Either way, it was rather an unpromising state of
      affairs, for the sands at the same time turned softer, and my footsteps,
      so soon as I had passed, were instantly filled with water. I began to have
      odd recollections concerning the snugness of your father&rsquo;s parlour, and
      the secure footing afforded by the pavement of Brown&rsquo;s Square and Scott&rsquo;s
      Close, when my better genius, the tall fisherman, appeared once more close
      to my side, he and his sable horse looming gigantic in the now darkening
      twilight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you mad?&rsquo; he said, in the same deep tone which had before thrilled on
      my ear, &lsquo;or are you weary of your life? You will be presently amongst the
      quicksands.&rsquo; I professed my ignorance of the way, to which he only
      replied, &lsquo;There is no time for prating&mdash;get up behind me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He probably expected me to spring from the ground with the activity which
      these Borderers have, by constant practice, acquired in everything
      relating to horsemanship; but as I stood irresolute, he extended his hand,
      and grasping mine, bid me place my foot on the toe of his boot, and thus
      raised me in a trice to the croupe of his horse. I was scarcely securely
      seated, ere he shook the reins of his horse, who instantly sprang forward;
      but annoyed, doubtless, by the unusual burden, treated us to two or three
      bounds, accompanied by as many flourishes of his hind heels. The rider sat
      like a tower, notwithstanding that the unexpected plunging of the animal
      threw me forward upon him. The horse was soon compelled to submit to the
      discipline of the spur and bridle, and went off at a steady hand gallop;
      thus shortening the devious, for it was by no means a direct path, by
      which the rider, avoiding the loose quicksands, made for the northern
      bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      My friend, perhaps I may call him my preserver,&mdash;for, to a stranger,
      my situation was fraught with real danger,&mdash;continued to press on at
      the same speedy pace, but in perfect silence, and I was under too much
      anxiety of mind to disturb him with any questions. At length we arrived at
      a part of the shore with which I was utterly unacquainted, when I alighted
      and began to return in the best fashion I could my thanks for the
      important service which he had just rendered me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger only replied by an impatient &lsquo;pshaw!&rsquo; and was about to ride
      off, and leave me to my own resources when I implored him to complete his
      work of kindness by directing me to Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush, which was, as I
      informed him, my home for the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush?&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;it is but three miles but if you know not
      the land better than the sand, you may break your neck before you get
      there; for it is no road for a moping boy in a dark night; and, besides,
      there are the brook and the fens to cross.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was a little dismayed at this communication of such difficulties as my
      habits had not called on me to contend with. Once more the idea of thy
      father&rsquo;s fireside came across me; and I could have been well contented to
      have swapped the romance of my situation, together with the glorious
      independence of control which I possessed at the moment, for the comforts
      of that chimney-corner, though I were obliged to keep my eyes chained to
      Erskine&rsquo;s LARGER INSTITUTES.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked my new friend whether he could not direct me to any house of
      public entertainment for the night; and supposing it probable he was
      himself a poor man, I added, with the conscious dignity of a well-filled
      pocket-book, that I could make it worth any man&rsquo;s while to oblige me. The
      fisherman making no answer, I turned away from him with as gallant an
      appearance of indifference as I could command, and began to take, as I
      thought, the path which he had pointed out to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      His deep voice immediately sounded after me to recall me. &lsquo;Stay, young
      man, stay&mdash;you have mistaken the road already.&mdash;I wonder your
      friends sent out such an inconsiderate youth, without some one wiser than
      himself to take care of him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps they might not have done so,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;if I had any friends who
      cared about the matter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;it is not my custom to open my house to strangers,
      but your pinch is like to be a smart one; for, besides the risk from bad
      roads, fords, and broken ground, and the night, which looks both black and
      gloomy, there is bad company on the road sometimes&mdash;at least it has a
      bad name, and some have come to harm; so that I think I must for once make
      my rule give way to your necessity, and give you a night&rsquo;s lodging in my
      cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why was it, Alan, that I could not help giving an involuntary shudder at
      receiving an invitation so seasonable in itself, and so suitable to my
      naturally inquisitive disposition? I easily suppressed this untimely
      sensation; and as I returned thanks, and expressed my hope that I should
      not disarrange, his family, I once more dropped a hint of my desire to
      make compensation for any trouble I might occasion. The man answered very
      coldly, &lsquo;Your presence will no doubt give me trouble, sir, but it is of a
      kind which your purse, cannot compensate; in a word, although I am content
      to receive you as my guest, I am no publican to call a reckoning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I begged his pardon, and, at his instance, once more seated myself behind
      hint upon the good horse, which went forth steady as before&mdash;the
      moon, whenever she could penetrate the clouds, throwing the huge shadow of
      the animal, with its double burden, on the wild and bare ground over which
      we passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thou mayst laugh till thou lettest the letter fall, if thou wilt, but it
      reminded me of the magician Atlantes on his hippogriff with a knight
      trussed up behind him, in the manner Ariosto has depicted that matter.
      Thou art I know, matter-of-fact enough to affect contempt of that
      fascinating and delicious poem; but think not that, to conform with thy
      bad taste, I shall forbear any suitable illustration which now or
      hereafter may occur to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      On we went, the sky blackening around us, and the wind beginning to pipe
      such a wild and melancholy tune as best suited the hollow sounds of the
      advancing tide, which I could hear at a distance, like the roar of some
      immense monster defrauded of its prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, our course was crossed by a deep dell or dingle, such as they
      call in some parts of Scotland a den, and in others a cleuch or narrow
      glen. It seemed, by the broken glances which the moon continued to throw
      upon it, to be steep, precipitous, and full of trees, which are, generally
      speaking, rather scarce upon these shores. The descent by which we plunged
      into this dell was both steep and rugged, with two or three abrupt
      turnings; but neither danger nor darkness impeded the motion of the black
      horse, who seemed rather to slide upon his haunches, than to gallop down
      the pass, throwing me again on the shoulders of the athletic rider, who,
      sustaining no inconvenience by the circumstance, continued to press the
      horse forward with his heel, steadily supporting him at the same time by
      raising his bridle-hand, until we stood in safety at the bottom of the
      steep&mdash;not a little to my consolation, as, friend Alan, thou mayst
      easily conceive.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very short advance up the glen, the bottom of which we had attained by
      this ugly descent, brought us in front of two or three cottages, one of
      which another blink of moonshine enabled me to rate as rather better than
      those of the Scottish peasantry in this part of the world; for the sashes
      seemed glazed, and there were what are called storm-windows in the roof,
      giving symptoms of the magnificence of a second story. The scene around
      was very interesting; for the cottages, and the yards or crofts annexed to
      them, occupied a haugh, or helm, of two acres, which a brook of some
      consequence (to judge from its roar) had left upon one side of the little
      glen while finding its course close to the farther bank, and which
      appeared to be covered and darkened with trees, while the level space
      beneath enjoyed such stormy smiles as the moon had that night to bestow.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had little time for observation, for my companion&rsquo;s loud whistle,
      seconded by an equally loud halloo, speedily brought to the door of the
      principal cottage a man and a woman, together with two large Newfoundland
      dogs, the deep baying of which I had for some time heard. A yelping
      terrier or two, which had joined the concert, were silent at the presence
      of my conductor, and began to whine, jump up, and fawn upon him. The
      female drew back when she beheld a stranger; the man, who had a lighted
      lantern, advanced, and, without any observation, received the horse from
      my host, and led him, doubtless, to stable, while I followed my conductor
      into the house. When we had passed the HALLAN, [The partition which
      divides a Scottish cottage.] we entered a well-sized apartment, with a
      clean brick floor, where a fire blazed (much to my contentment) in the
      ordinary projecting sort of a chimney, common in Scottish houses. There
      were stone seats within the chimney; and ordinary utensils, mixed with
      fishing-spears, nets, and similar implements of sport, were hung around
      the walls of the place. The female who had first appeared at the door, had
      now retreated into a side apartment. She was presently followed by my
      guide, after he had silently motioned me to a seat; and their place was
      supplied by an elderly woman, in a grey stuff gown, with a check apron and
      toy, obviously a menial, though neater in her dress than is usual in her
      apparent rank&mdash;an advantage which was counterbalanced by a very
      forbidding aspect. But the most singular part of her attire, in this very
      Protestant country, was a rosary, in which the smaller beads were black
      oak, and those indicating the PATER-NOSTER of silver, with a crucifix of
      the same metal.
    </p>
    <p>
      This person made preparations for supper, by spreading a clean though
      coarse cloth over a large oaken table, placing trenchers and salt upon it,
      and arranging the fire to receive a gridiron. I observed her motions in
      silence; for she took no sort of notice of me, and as her looks were
      singularly forbidding, I felt no disposition to commence conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this duenna had made all preliminary arrangements, she took from the
      well-filled pouch of my conductor, which he had hung up by the door, one
      or two salmon, or GRILSES, as the smaller sort are termed, and selecting
      that which seemed best and in highest season, began to cut it into slices,
      and to prepare a GRILLADE; the savoury smell of which affected me so
      powerfully that I began sincerely to hope that no delay would intervene
      between the platter and the lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      As this thought came across me, the man who had conducted the horse to the
      stable entered the apartment, and discovered to me a countenance yet more
      uninviting than that of the old crone who was performing with such
      dexterity the office of cook to the party. He was perhaps sixty years old;
      yet his brow was not much furrowed, and his jet-black hair was only
      grizzled, not whitened, by the advance of age. All his motions spoke
      strength unabated; and, though rather undersized, he had very broad
      shoulders, was square-made, thin-flanked, and apparently combined in his
      frame muscular strength and activity; the last somewhat impaired perhaps
      by years, but the first remaining in full vigour. A hard and harsh
      countenance&mdash;eyes far sunk under projecting eyebrows, which were
      grizzled like his hair&mdash;a wide mouth, furnished from ear to ear with
      it range of unimpaired teeth, of uncommon whiteness, and a size and
      breadth which might have become the jaws of an ogre, completed this
      delightful portrait. He was clad like a fisherman, in jacket and trousers
      of the blue cloth commonly used by seamen, and had a Dutch case-knife,
      like that of a Hamburgh skipper, stuck into a broad buff belt, which
      seemed as if it might occasionally sustain weapons of a description still
      less equivocally calculated for violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      This man gave me an inquisitive, and, as I thought, a sinister look upon
      entering the apartment; but without any further notice of me, took up the
      office of arranging the table, which the old lady had abandoned for that
      of cooking the fish, and, with more address than I expected from a person
      of his coarse appearance, placed two chairs at the head of the table, and
      two stools below; accommodating each seat to a cover, beside which he
      placed an allowance of barley-bread, and a small jug, which he replenished
      with ale from a large black jack. Three of these jugs were of ordinary
      earthenware, but the fourth, which he placed by the right-hand cover at,
      the upper end of the table, was a flagon of silver, and displayed armorial
      bearings. Beside this flagon he placed a salt-cellar of silver, handsomely
      wrought, containing salt of exquisite whiteness, with pepper and other
      spices. A sliced lemon was also presented on a small silver salver. The
      two large water-dogs, who seemed perfectly to understand the nature of the
      preparations, seated themselves one on each side of the table, to be ready
      to receive their portion of the entertainment. I never saw finer animals,
      or which seemed to be more influenced by a sense of decorum, excepting
      that they slobbered a little as the rich scent from the chimney was wafted
      past their noses. The small dogs ensconced themselves beneath the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am aware that I am dwelling upon trivial and ordinary circumstances, and
      that perhaps I may weary out your patience in doing so. But conceive me
      alone in this strange place, which seemed, from the universal silence, to
      be the very temple of Harpocrates&mdash;remember that this is my first
      excursion from home&mdash;forget not that the manner in which I had been
      brought hither had the dignity of danger and something the air of an
      adventure, and that there was a mysterious incongruity in all I had
      hitherto witnessed; and you will not, I think, be surprised that these
      circumstances, though trifling, should force themselves on my notice at
      the time, and dwell in my memory afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      That a fisher, who pursued the sport perhaps for his amusement as well as
      profit, should be well mounted and better lodged than the lower class of
      peasantry, had in it nothing surprising; but there was something about all
      that I saw which seemed to intimate that I was rather in the abode of a
      decayed gentleman, who clung to a few of the forms and observances of
      former rank, than in that of a common peasant, raised above his fellows by
      comparative opulence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides the articles of plate which I have already noticed, the old man
      now lighted and placed on the table a silver lamp, or CRUISIE as the
      Scottish term it, filled with very pure oil, which in burning diffused an
      aromatic fragrance, and gave me a more perfect view of the cottage walls,
      which I had hitherto only seen dimly by the light of the fire. The BINK
      [The frame of wooden shelves placed in a Scottish kitchen for holding
      plates.] with its usual arrangement of pewter and earthenware, which was
      most strictly and critically clean, glanced back the flame of the lamp
      merrily from one side of the apartment. In a recess, formed by the small
      bow of a latticed window, was a large writing-desk of walnut-tree wood,
      curiously carved, above which arose shelves of the same, which supported a
      few books and papers. The opposite side of the recess contained (as far as
      I could discern, for it lay in shadow, and I could at any rate have seen
      it but imperfectly from the place where I was seated) one or two guns,
      together with swords, pistols, and other arms a collection which, in a
      poor cottage, and in a country so peaceful, appeared singular at least, if
      not even somewhat suspicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these observations, you may suppose, were made much sooner than I have
      recorded, or you (if you have not skipped) have been able to read them.
      They were already finished, and I was considering how I should open some
      communication with the mute inhabitants of the mansion, when my conductor
      re-entered from the side-door by which he had made his exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had now thrown off his rough riding-cap, and his coarse jockey-coat,
      And stood before me in a grey jerkin trimmed with black, which sat close
      to, and set off, his large and sinewy frame, and a pair of trousers of a
      lighter colour, cut as close to the body as they are used by Highlandmen.
      His whole dress was of finer cloth than that of the old man; and his
      linen, so minute was my observation, clean and unsullied. His shirt was
      without ruffles, and tied at the collar with a black ribbon, which showed
      his strong and muscular neck rising from it like that of an ancient
      Hercules. His head was small, with a large forehead, and well-formed ears.
      He wore neither peruke nor hair-powder; and his chestnut locks, curling
      close to his head like those of an antique statue, showed not the least
      touch of time, though the owner must have been at least fifty. His
      features were high and prominent in such a degree that one knew not
      whether to term them harsh or handsome. In either case, the sparkling grey
      eye, aquiline nose, and well-formed mouth, combined to render his
      physiognomy noble and expressive. An air of sadness, or severity, or of
      both, seemed to indicate a melancholy, and, at the same time, a haughty
      temper. I could not help running mentally over the ancient heroes, to whom
      I might assimilate the noble form and countenance before me. He was too
      young, and evinced too little resignation to his fate, to resemble
      Belisarius. Coriolanus, standing by the hearth of Tullus Aufidius, came
      nearer the mark; yet the gloomy and haughty look of the stranger had,
      perhaps, still more of Marius, seated among the ruins of Carthage.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I was lost in these imaginations, my host stood by the fire, gazing
      on me with the same attention which I paid to him, until, embarrassed by
      his look, I was about to break silence at all hazards. But the supper, now
      placed upon the table, reminded me, by its appearance, of those wants
      which I had almost forgotten while I was gazing on the fine form of my
      conductor. He spoke at length, and I almost started at the deep rich tone
      of his voice, though what he said was but to invite me to sit down to the
      table. He himself assumed the seat of honour, beside which the silver
      flagon was placed, and beckoned to me to sit down beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thou knowest thy father&rsquo;s strict and excellent domestic discipline has
      trained me to bear the invocation of a blessing before we break the daily
      bread, for which we are taught to pray&mdash;I paused a moment, and,
      without designing to do so, I suppose my manner made him sensible of what
      I expected. The two domestics or inferiors, as I should have before
      observed, were already seated at the bottom of the table, when my host
      shot a glance of a very peculiar expression towards the old man,
      observing, with something approaching to a sneer, &lsquo;Cristal Nixon, say
      grace&mdash;the gentleman expects one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The foul fiend shall be clerk, and say amen, when I turn chaplain,&rsquo; 
      growled out the party addressed, in tones which might have become the
      condition of a dying bear; &lsquo;if the gentleman is a whig, he may please
      himself with his own mummery. My faith is neither in word nor writ, but in
      barley-bread and brown ale.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mabel Moffat,&rsquo; said my guide, looking at the old woman, and raising his
      sonorous voice, probably because she was hard of hearing, &lsquo;canst thou ask
      a blessing upon our victuals?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman shook her head, kissed the cross which hung from her rosary,
      and was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mabel will say grace for no heretic,&rsquo; said the master of the house, with
      the same latent sneer on his brow and in his accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment, the side-door already mentioned opened, and the young
      woman (so she proved) whom I had first seen at the door of the cottage,
      advanced a little way into the room, then stopped bashfully, as if she had
      observed that I was looking at her, and asked the master of the house, &lsquo;if
      he had called?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not louder than to make old Mabel hear me,&rsquo; he replied; &lsquo;and yet,&rsquo; be
      added, as she turned to retire, &lsquo;it is a shame a stranger should see a
      house where not one of the family can or will say a grace&mdash;do thou be
      our chaplain.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl, who was really pretty, came forward with timid modesty, and,
      apparently unconscious that she was doing anything uncommon, pronounced
      the benediction in a silver-toned voice, and with affecting simplicity&mdash;her
      cheek colouring just so much as to show that on a less solemn occasion she
      would have felt more embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, if thou expectest a fine description of this young woman, Alan
      Fairford, in order to entitle thee to taunt me with having found a
      Dulcinea in the inhabitant of a fisherman&rsquo;s cottage on the Solway Firth,
      thou shalt be disappointed; for, having said she seemed very pretty, and
      that she was a sweet and gentle-speaking creature, I have said all
      concerning her that I can tell thee. She vanished when the benediction was
      spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      My host, with a muttered remark on the cold of our ride, and the keen air
      of the Solway Sands, to which he did not seem to wish an answer, loaded my
      plate from Mabel&rsquo;s grillade, which, with a large wooden bowl of potatoes,
      formed our whole meal. A sprinkling from the lemon gave a much higher zest
      than the usual condiment of vinegar; and I promise you that whatever I
      might hitherto have felt, either of curiosity or suspicion, did not
      prevent me from making a most excellent supper, during which little passed
      betwixt me and my entertainer, unless that he did the usual honours of the
      table with courtesy, indeed, but without even the affectation of hearty
      hospitality, which those in his (apparent) condition generally affect on
      such occasions, even when they do not actually feel it. On the contrary,
      his manner seemed that of a polished landlord towards an unexpected and
      unwelcome guest, whom, for the sake of his own credit, he receives with
      civility, but without either goodwill or cheerfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you ask how I learned all this, I cannot tell you; nor, were I to write
      down at length the insignificant intercourse which took place between us,
      would it perhaps serve to justify these observations. It is sufficient to
      say, that in helping his dogs, which he did from time to time with great
      liberality, he seemed to discharge a duty much more pleasing to himself,
      than when he paid the same attention to his guest. Upon the whole, the
      result on my mind was as I tell it you.
    </p>
    <p>
      When supper was over, a small case-bottle of brandy, in a curious frame of
      silver filigree, circulated to the guests. I had already taken a small
      glass of the liquor, and, when it had passed to Mabel and to Cristal and
      was again returned to the upper end of the table, I could not help taking
      the bottle in my hand, to look more at the armorial bearings which were
      chased with considerable taste on the silver framework. Encountering the
      eye of my entertainer, I instantly saw that my curiosity was highly
      distasteful; he frowned, bit his lip, and showed such uncontrollable signs
      of impatience, that, setting the bottle immediately down, I attempted some
      apology. To this he did not deign either to reply, or even to listen; and
      Cristal, at a signal from his master, removed the object of my curiosity,
      as well as the cup, upon which the same arms were engraved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then ensued an awkward pause, which I endeavoured to break by observing,
      that &lsquo;I feared my intrusion upon his hospitality had put his family to
      some inconvenience&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope you see no appearance of it, sir,&rsquo; he replied, with cold civility.
      &lsquo;What inconvenience a family so retired as ours may suffer from receiving
      an unexpected guest is like to be trifling, in comparison of what the
      visitor himself sustains from want of his accustomed comforts. So far,
      therefore, as our connexion stands, our accounts stand clear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding this discouraging reply, I blundered on, as is usual in
      such cases, wishing to appear civil, and being, perhaps, in reality the
      very reverse. &lsquo;I was afraid,&rsquo; I said, that my presence had banished one of
      the family&rsquo; (looking at the side-door) &lsquo;from his table.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If,&rsquo; he coldly replied, &lsquo;I meant the young woman whom I had seen in the
      apartment, he bid me observe that there was room enough at the table for
      her to have seated herself, and meat enough, such as it was, for her
      supper. I might, therefore, be assured, if she had chosen it, she would
      have supped with us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no dwelling on this or any other topic longer; for my
      entertainer, taking up the lamp, observed, that &lsquo;my wet clothes might
      reconcile me for the night to their custom of keeping early hours; that he
      was under the necessity of going abroad by peep of day to-morrow morning,
      and would call me up at the same time, to point out the way by which I was
      to return to the Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This left no opening for further explanation; nor was there room for it on
      the usual terms of civility; for, as he neither asked my name, nor
      expressed the least interest concerning my condition, I&mdash;the obliged
      person&mdash;had no pretence to trouble him with such inquiries on my
      part.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took up the lamp, and led me through the side-door into a very small
      room, where a bed had been hastily arranged for my accommodation, and,
      putting down the lamp, directed me to leave my wet clothes on the outside
      of the door, that they might be exposed to the fire during the night. He
      then left me, having muttered something which was meant to pass for good
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      I obeyed his directions with respect to my clothes, the rather that, in
      despite of the spirits which I had drunk, I felt my teeth begin to
      chatter, and received various hints from an aguish feeling, that a
      town-bred youth, like myself, could not at once rush into all the
      hardihood of country sports with impunity. But my bed, though coarse and
      hard, was dry and clean; and I soon was so little occupied with my heats
      and tremors, as to listen with interest to a heavy foot, which seemed to
      be that of my landlord, traversing the boards (there was no ceiling, as
      you may believe) which roofed my apartment. Light, glancing through these
      rude planks, became visible as soon as my lamp was extinguished; and as
      the noise of the slow, solemn, and regular step continued, and I could
      distinguish that the person turned and returned as he reached the end of
      the apartment, it seemed clear to me that the walker was engaged in no
      domestic occupation, but merely pacing to and fro for his own pleasure.
      &lsquo;An odd amusement this,&rsquo; I thought, &lsquo;for one who had been engaged at least
      a part of the preceding day in violent exercise, and who talked of rising
      by the peep of dawn on the ensuing morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime I heard the storm, which had been brewing during the evening,
      begin to descend with a vengeance; sounds as of distant-thunder (the noise
      of the more distant waves, doubtless, on the shore) mingled with the
      roaring of the neighbouring torrent, and with the crashing, groaning, and
      even screaming of the trees in the glen whose boughs were tormented by the
      gale. Within the house, windows clattered, and doors clapped, and the
      walls, though sufficiently substantial for a building of the kind, seemed
      to me to totter in the tempest.
    </p>
    <p>
      But still the heavy steps perambulating the apartment over my head were
      distinctly heard amid the roar and fury of the elements. I thought more
      than once I even heard a groan; but I frankly own that, placed in this
      unusual situation, my fancy may have misled me. I was tempted several
      times to call aloud, and ask whether the turmoil around us did not
      threaten danger to the building which we inhabited; but when I thought of
      the secluded and unsocial master of the dwelling, who seemed to avoid
      human society, and to remain unperturbed amid the elemental war, it seemed
      that to speak to him at that moment would have been to address the spirit
      of the tempest himself, since no other being, I thought, could have
      remained calm and tranquil while winds and waters were thus raging around.
    </p>
    <p>
      In process of time, fatigue prevailed over anxiety and curiosity. The
      storm abated, or my senses became deadened to its terrors, and I fell
      asleep ere yet the mysterious paces of my host had ceased to shake the
      flooring over my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might have been expected that the novelty of my situation, although it
      did not prevent my slumbers, would have at least diminished their
      profoundness, and shortened their duration. It proved otherwise, however;
      for I never slept more soundly in my life, and only awoke when, at morning
      dawn, my landlord shook me by the shoulder, and dispelled some dream, of
      which, fortunately for you, I have no recollection, otherwise you would
      have been favoured with it, in hopes you might have proved a second Daniel
      upon the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You sleep sound&mdash;&rsquo; said his full deep voice; &lsquo;ere five years have
      rolled over your head, your slumbers will be lighter&mdash;unless ere then
      you are wrapped in the sleep which is never broken.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How!&rsquo; said I, starting up in the bed; &lsquo;do you know anything of me&mdash;of
      my prospects&mdash;of my views in life?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; he answered, with a grim smile; &lsquo;but it is evident you are
      entering upon the world young, inexperienced, and full of hopes, and I do
      but prophesy to you what I would to any one in your condition. But come;
      there lie your clothes&mdash;a brown crust and a draught of milk wait you,
      if you choose to break your fast; but you must make haste.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must first,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;take the freedom to spend a few minutes alone,
      before beginning the ordinary works of the day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&mdash;umph!&mdash;I cry your devotions pardon,&rsquo; he replied, and left
      the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan, there is something terrible about this man.
    </p>
    <p>
      I joined him, as I had promised, in the kitchen where we had supped
      overnight, where I found the articles which he had offered me for
      breakfast, without butter or any other addition.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked up and down while I partook of the bread and milk; and the slow
      measured weighty step seemed identified with those which I had heard last
      night. His pace, from its funereal slowness, seemed to keep time with some
      current of internal passion, dark, slow, and unchanged. &lsquo;We run and leap
      by the side of a lively and bubbling brook,&rsquo; thought I, internally, &lsquo;as if
      we would run a race with it; but beside waters deep, slow, and lonely, our
      pace is sullen and silent as their course. What thoughts may be now
      corresponding with that furrowed brow, and bearing time with that heavy
      step?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you have finished,&rsquo; said he, looking up to me with a glance of
      impatience, as he observed that I ate no longer, but remained with my eyes
      fixed upon him, &lsquo;I wait to show you the way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We went out together, no individual of the family having been visible
      excepting my landlord. I was disappointed of the opportunity which I
      watched for of giving some gratuity to the domestics, as they seemed to
      be. As for offering any recompense to the master of the household, it
      seemed to me impossible to have attempted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      What would I have given for a share of thy composure, who wouldst have
      thrust half a crown into a man&rsquo;s hand whose necessities seemed to crave
      it, conscious that you did right in making the proffer, and not caring
      sixpence whether you hurt the feelings of him whom you meant to serve! I
      saw thee once give a penny to a man with a long beard, who, from the
      dignity of his exterior, might have represented Solon. I had not thy
      courage, and therefore I made no tender to my mysterious host, although,
      notwithstanding his display of silver utensils, all around the house
      bespoke narrow circumstances, if not actual poverty.
    </p>
    <p>
      We left the place together. But I hear thee murmur thy very new and
      appropriate ejaculation, OHE, JAM SATIS!&mdash;The rest for another time.
      Perhaps I may delay further communication till I learn how my favours are
      valued.

    <h2>
      LETTER V
    </h2>
    <h3>
      ALAN FAIRFORD TO DARSIE LATIMER
    </h3>
    <p>
      I have thy two last epistles, my dear Darsie, and expecting the third,
      have been in no hurry to answer them. Do not think my silence ought to be
      ascribed to my failing to take interest in them, for, truly, they excel
      (though the task was difficult) thy usual excellings. Since the moon-calf
      who earliest discovered the Pandemonium of Milton in an expiring wood-fire&mdash;since
      the first ingenious urchin who blew bubbles out of soap and water, thou,
      my best of friends, hast the highest knack at making histories out of
      nothing. Wert thou to plant the bean in the nursery-tale, thou wouldst
      make out, so soon as it began to germinate, that the castle of the giant
      was about to elevate its battlements on the top of it. All that happens to
      thee gets a touch of the wonderful and the sublime from thy own rich
      imagination. Didst ever see what artists call a Claude Lorraine glass,
      which spreads its own particular hue over the whole landscape which you
      see through it?&mdash;thou beholdest ordinary events just through such a
      medium.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have looked carefully at the facts of thy last long letter, and they are
      just such as might have befallen any little truant of the High School, who
      had got down to Leith Sands, gone beyond the PRAWN-DUB, wet his hose and
      shoon, and, finally, had been carried home, in compassion, by some
      high-kilted fishwife, cursing all the while the trouble which the brat
      occasioned her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I admire the figure which thou must have made, clinging for dear life
      behind the old fellow&rsquo;s back&mdash;thy jaws chattering with fear, thy
      muscles cramped with anxiety. Thy execrable supper of broiled salmon,
      which was enough to ensure the nightmare&rsquo;s regular visits for a
      twelvemonth, may be termed a real affliction; but as for the storm of
      Thursday last (such, I observe, was the date), it roared, whistled,
      howled, and bellowed, as fearfully amongst the old chimney-heads in the
      Candlemaker Row, as it could on the Solway shore, for the very wind of it&mdash;TESTE
      ME PER TOTAM NOCTEM VIGILANTE. And then in the morning again, when&mdash;Lord
      help you&mdash;in your sentimental delicacy you bid the poor man adieu,
      without even tendering him half a crown for supper and lodging!
    </p>
    <p>
      You laugh at me for giving a penny (to be accurate, though, thou shouldst
      have said sixpence) to an old fellow, whom thou, in thy high flight,
      wouldst have sent home supperless, because he was like Solon or
      Belisarius. But you forget that the affront descended like a benediction
      into the pouch of the old gaberlunzie, who overflowed in blessings upon
      the generous donor&mdash;long ere he would have thanked thee, Darsie, for
      thy barren veneration of his beard and his bearing. Then you laugh at my
      good father&rsquo;s retreat from Falkirk, just as if it were not time for a man
      to trudge when three or four mountain knaves, with naked claymores, and
      heels as light as their fingers, were scampering after him, crying
      FURINISH. You remember what he said himself when the Laird of Bucklivat
      told him that FURINISH signified &lsquo;stay a while&rsquo;. &lsquo;What the devil,&rsquo; he
      said, surprised out of his Presbyterian correctness by the
      unreasonableness of such a request under the circumstances, &lsquo;would the
      scoundrels have had me stop to have my head cut off?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine such a train at your own heels, Darsie, and ask yourself whether
      you would not exert your legs as fast as you did in flying from the Solway
      tide. And yet you impeach my father&rsquo;s courage. I tell you he has courage
      enough to do what is right, and to spurn what is wrong&mdash;courage
      enough to defend a righteous cause with hand and purse, and to take the
      part of the poor man against his oppressor, without fear of the
      consequences to himself. This is civil courage, Darsie; and it is of
      little consequence to most men in this age and country whether they ever
      possess military courage or no.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not think I am angry with you, though I thus attempt to rectify your
      opinions on my father&rsquo;s account. I am well aware that, upon the whole, he
      is scarce regarded with more respect by me than by thee. And, while I am
      in a serious humour, which it is difficult to preserve with one who is
      perpetually tempting me to laugh at him, pray, dearest Darsie, let not thy
      ardour for adventure carry thee into more such scrapes as that of the
      Solway Sands. The rest of the story is a mere imagination; but that stormy
      evening might have proved, as the clown says to Lear, &lsquo;a naughty night to
      swim in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the rest, if you can work mysterious and romantic heroes out of old
      cross-grained fishermen, why, I for one will reap some amusement by the
      metamorphosis. Yet hold! even there, there is some need of caution. This
      same female chaplain&mdash;thou sayest so little of her, and so much of
      every one else, that it excites some doubt in my mind. VERY PRETTY she is,
      it seems&mdash;and that is all thy discretion informs me of. There are
      cases in which silence implies other things than consent. Wert thou
      ashamed or afraid, Darsie, to trust thyself with the praises of the very
      pretty grace-sayer?&mdash;As I live, thou blushest! Why, do I not know
      thee an inveterate squire of dames? and have I not been in thy confidence?
      An elegant elbow, displayed when the rest of the figure was muffled in a
      cardinal, or a neat well-turned ankle and instep, seen by chance as its
      owner tripped up the Old Assembly Close, [Of old this almost deserted
      alley formed the most common access betwixt the High Street and the
      southern suburbs.] turned thy brain for eight days. Thou wert once caught
      if I remember rightly, with a single glance of a single matchless eye,
      which, when the fair owner withdrew her veil, proved to be single in the
      literal sense of the word. And, besides, were you not another time
      enamoured of a voice&mdash;a mere voice, that mingled in the psalmody at
      the Old Greyfriars&rsquo; Church&mdash;until you discovered the proprietor of
      that dulcet organ to be Miss Dolly MacIzzard, who is both &lsquo;back and
      breast&rsquo;, as our saying goes?
    </p>
    <p>
      All these things considered, and contrasted with thy artful silence on the
      subject of this grace-saying Nereid of thine, I must beg thee to be more
      explicit upon that subject in thy next, unless thou wouldst have me form
      the conclusion that thou thinkest more of her than thou carest to talk of.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will not expect much news from this quarter, as you know the monotony
      of my life, and are aware it must at present be devoted to uninterrupted
      study. You have said a thousand times that I am only qualified to make my
      way by dint of plodding, and therefore plod I must.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father seems to be more impatient of your absence than he was after
      your first departure. He is sensible, I believe, that our solitary meals
      want the light which your gay humour was wont to throw over them, and
      feels melancholy as men do when the light of the sun is no longer upon the
      landscape. If it is thus with him, thou mayst imagine it is much more so
      with me, and canst conceive how heartily I wish that thy frolic were
      ended, and thou once more our inmate.&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I resume my pen, after a few hours&rsquo; interval, to say that an incident has
      occurred on which you will yourself be building a hundred castles in the
      air, and which even I, jealous as I am of such baseless fabrics, cannot
      but own affords ground for singular conjecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father has of late taken me frequently along with him when he attends
      the courts, in his anxiety to see me properly initiated into the practical
      forms of business. I own I feel something on his account and my own from
      this over-anxiety, which, I dare say, renders us both ridiculous. But what
      signifies my repugnance? my father drags me up to his counsel learned in
      the law,&mdash;&lsquo;Are you quite ready to come on to-day, Mr. Crossbite?&mdash;This
      is my son, designed for the bar&mdash;I take the liberty to bring him with
      me to-day to the consultation, merely that he may see how these things are
      managed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crossbite smiles and bows; as a lawyer smiles on the solicitor who
      employs him, and I dare say, thrusts his tongue into his cheek, and
      whispers into the first great wig that passes him, &lsquo;What the d&mdash;l
      does old Fairford mean by letting loose his whelp on me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As I stood beside them, too much vexed at the childish part I was made to
      play to derive much information from the valuable arguments of Mr.
      Crossbite, I observed a rather elderly man, who stood with his eyes firmly
      bent on my father, as if he only waited an end of the business in which he
      was engaged, to address him. There was something, I thought, in the
      gentleman&rsquo;s appearance which commanded attention. Yet his dress was not in
      the present taste, and though it had once been magnificent, was now
      antiquated and unfashionable. His coat was of branched velvet, with a
      satin lining, a waistcoat of violet-coloured silk, much embroidered; his
      breeches the same stuff as the coat. He wore square-toed shoes, with
      foretops, as they are called; and his silk stockings were rolled up over
      his knee, as you may have seen in pictures, and here and there on some of
      those originals who seem to pique themselves on dressing after the mode of
      Methuselah. A CHAPEAU BRAS and sword necessarily completed his equipment,
      which, though out of date, showed that it belonged to a man of
      distinction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The instant Mr. Crossbite had ended what he had to say, this gentleman
      walked up to my father, with, &lsquo;Your servant, Mr. Fairford&mdash;it is long
      since you and I met.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father, whose politeness, you know, is exact and formal, bowed, and
      hemmed, and was confused, and at length professed that the distance since
      they had met was so great, that though he remembered the face perfectly,
      the name, he was sorry to any, had&mdash;really&mdash;somehow&mdash;escaped
      his memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you forgot Herries of Birrenswork?&rsquo; said the gentleman, and my
      father bowed even more profoundly than before; though I think his
      reception of his old friend seemed to lose some of the respectful civility
      which he bestowed on him while his name was yet unknown. It now seemed to
      be something like the lip-courtesy which the heart would have denied had
      ceremony permitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father, however, again bowed low, and hoped he saw him well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So well, my good Mr. Fairford, that I come hither determined to renew my
      acquaintance with one or two old friends, and with you in the first place.
      I halt at my old resting place&mdash;you must dine with me to-day, at
      Paterson&rsquo;s, at the head of the Horse Wynd&mdash;it is near your new
      fashionable dwelling, and I have business with you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father excused himself respectfully, and not without embarrassment&mdash;&lsquo;he
      was particularly engaged at home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I will dine with you, man,&rsquo; said Mr. Herries of Birrenswork; &lsquo;the
      few minutes you can spare me after dinner will suffice for my business;
      and I will not prevent you a moment from minding your own&mdash;I am no
      bottle-man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      You have often remarked that my father, though a scrupulous ohserver of
      the rites of hospitality, seems to exercise them rather as a duty than as
      a pleasure; indeed, but for a conscientious wish to feed the hungry and
      receive the stranger, his doors would open to guests much seldomer than is
      the case. I never saw so strong an example of this peculiarity (which I
      should otherwise have said is caricatured in your description) as in his
      mode of homologating the self-given invitation of Mr. Herries. The
      embarsassed brow, and the attempt at a smile which accompanied his &lsquo;We
      will expect the honour of seeing you in Brown Square at three o&rsquo;clock,&rsquo; 
      could not deceive any one, and did not impose upon the old laird. It was
      with a look of scorn that he replied, &lsquo;I will relieve you then till that
      hour, Mr. Fairford;&rsquo; and his whole manner seemed to say, &lsquo;It is my
      pleasure to dine with you, and I care not whether I am welcome or no.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When he turned away, I asked my father who he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An unfortunate gentleman,&rsquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He looks pretty well on his misfortunes,&rsquo; replied I. &lsquo;I should not have
      suspected that so gay an outside was lacking a dinner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who told you that he does?&rsquo; replied my father; &lsquo;he is OMNI SUSPICIONE
      MAJOR, so far as worldly circumstances are concerned. It is to be hoped he
      makes a good use of them; though, if he does, it will be for the first
      time in his life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has then been an irregular liver?&rsquo; insinuated I.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father replied by that famous brocard with which he silences all
      unacceptable queries turning in the slightest degree upon the failings of
      our neighbours,&mdash;&lsquo;If we mend our own faults, Alan, we shall all of us
      have enough to do, without sitting in judgement upon other folks.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here I was again at fault; but rallying once more, I observed, he had the
      air of a man of high rank and family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is well entitled,&rsquo; said my father, &lsquo;representing Herries of
      Birrenswork; a branch of that great and once powerful family of Herries,
      the elder branch whereof merged in the house of Nithesdale at the death of
      Lord Robin the Philosopher, Anno Domini sixteen hundred and sixty-seven.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has he still,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;his patrimonial estate of Birrenswork?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied my father; &lsquo;so far back as his father&rsquo;s time, it was a mere
      designation&mdash;the property being forfeited by Herbert Herries
      following his kinsman the Earl of Derwentwater to the Preston affair in
      1715. But they keep up the designation, thinking, doubtless, that their
      claims may be revived in more favourable times for Jacobites and for
      popery; and folks who in no way partake of their fantastic capriccios do
      yet allow it to pass unchallenged, EX COMITATE, if not EX MISERICORDIA.&mdash;But
      were he the Pope and the Pretender both, we must get some dinner ready for
      him, since he has thought fit to offer himself. So hasten home, my lad,
      and tell Hannah, Cook Epps, and James Wilkinson, to do their best; and do
      thou look out a pint or two of Maxwell&rsquo;s best&mdash;it is in the fifth bin&mdash;there
      are the keys of the wine-cellar. Do not leave them in the lock&mdash;you
      know poor James&rsquo;s failing, though he is an honest creature under all other
      temptations&mdash;and I have but two bottles of the old brandy left&mdash;we
      must keep it for medicine, Alan.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Away went I&mdash;made my preparations&mdash;the hour of dinner came, and
      so did Mr. Herries of Birrenswork.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I had thy power of imagination and description, Darsie, I could make
      out a fine, dark, mysterious, Rembrandt-looking portrait of this same
      stranger, which should be as far superior to thy fisherman as a shirt of
      chain-mail is to a herring-net. I can assure you there is some matter for
      description about him; but knowing my own imperfections, I can only say, I
      thought him eminently disagreeable and ill-bred.&mdash;No, ILL-BRED is not
      the proper word on the contrary, he appeared to know the rules of
      good-breeding perfectly, and only to think that the rank of the company
      did not require that he should attend to them&mdash;a view of the matter
      infinitely more offensive than if his behaviour had been that of
      uneducated and proper rudeness. While my father said grace, the laird did
      all but whistle aloud; and when I, at my father&rsquo;s desire, returned thanks,
      he used his toothpick, as if he had waited that moment for its exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much for Kirk&mdash;with King, matters went even worse. My father, thou
      knowest, is particularly full of deference to his guests; and in the
      present care, he seemed more than usually desirous to escape every cause
      of dispute. He so far compromised his loyalty as to announce merely &lsquo;The
      King&rsquo; as his first toast after dinner, instead of the emphatic &lsquo;King
      George&rsquo;, which is his usual formula. Our guest made a motion with his
      glass, so as to pass it over the water-decanter which stood beside him,
      and added, &lsquo;Over the water.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father coloured, but would not seem to hear this. Much more there was
      of careless and disrespectful in the stranger&rsquo;s manner and tone of
      conversation; so that, though I know my father&rsquo;s prejudices in favour of
      rank and birth, and though I am aware his otherwise masculine
      understanding has never entirely shaken off the slavish awe of the great
      which in his earlier days they had so many modes of commanding, still I
      could hardly excuse him for enduring so much insolence&mdash;such it
      seemed to be as this self-invited guest was disposed to offer to him at
      his own table.
    </p>
    <p>
      One can endure a traveller in the same carriage, if he treads upon your
      toes by accident, or even through negligence; but it is very different
      when, knowing that they are rather of a tender description, he continues
      to pound away at them with his hoofs. In my poor opinion&mdash;and I am a
      man of peace&mdash;you can, in that case, hardly avoid a declaration of
      war.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe my father read my thoughts in my eye; for, pulling out his
      watch, he said; &lsquo;Half-past four, Alan&mdash;you should be in your own room
      by this time&mdash;Birrenswork will excuse you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Our visitor nodded carelessly, and I had no longer any pretence to remain.
      But as I left the room, I heard this magnate of Nithesdale distinctly
      mention the name of Latimer. I lingered; but at length a direct hint from
      my father obliged me to withdraw; and when, an hour afterwards, I was
      summoned to partake of a cup of tea, our guest had departed. He had
      business that evening in the High Street, and could not spare time even to
      drink tea. I could not help saying, I considered his departure as a relief
      from incivility. &lsquo;What business has he to upbraid us,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;with the
      change of our dwelling from a more inconvenient to a better quarter of the
      town? What was it to him if we chose to imitate some of the conveniences
      or luxuries of an English dwelling-house, instead of living piled up above
      each other in flats? Have his patrician birth and aristocratic fortunes
      given him any right to censure those who dispose of the fruits of their
      own industry, according to their own pleasure?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father took a long pinch of snuff, and replied, &lsquo;Very well, Alan; very
      well indeed. I wish Mr. Crossbite or Counsellor Pest had heard you; they
      must have acknowledged that you have a talent for forensic elocution; and
      it may not be amiss to try a little declamation at home now and then, to
      gather audacity and keep yourself in breath. But touching the subject of
      this paraffle of words, it&rsquo;s not worth a pinch of tobacco. D&rsquo;ye think that
      I care for Mr. Herries of Birrenswork more than any other gentleman who
      comes here about business, although I do not care to go tilting at his
      throat, because he speaks like a grey goose, as he is? But to say no more
      about him, I want to have Darsie Latimer&rsquo;s present direction; for it is
      possible I may have to write the lad a line with my own hand&mdash;and yet
      I do not well know&mdash;but give me the direction at all events.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I did so, and if you have heard from my father accordingly, you know more,
      probably, about the subject of this letter than I who write it. But if you
      have not, then shall I have discharged a friend&rsquo;s duty, in letting you
      know that there certainly is something afloat between this disagreeable
      laird and my father, in which you are considerably interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adieu! and although I have given thee a subject for waking dreams, beware
      of building a castle too heavy for the foundation; which, in the present
      instance, is barely the word Latimer occurring in a conversation betwixt a
      gentleman of Dumfriesshire and a W.S. of Edinburgh&mdash;CAETERA PRORSUS
      IGNORO.

      LETTER VI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      DARSIE LATIMER TO ALAN FAIRFORD
    </h3>
    <p>
      (In continuation of Letters III and IV.)
    </p>
    <p>
      I told thee I walked out into the open air with my grave and stern
      landlord. I could now see more perfectly than on the preceding night the
      secluded glen in which stood the two or three cottages which appeared to
      be the abode of him and his family.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was so narrow, in proportion to its depth, that no ray of the morning
      sun was likely to reach it till it should rise high in the horizon.
      Looking up the dell, you saw a brawling brook issuing in foamy haste from
      a covert of underwood, like a race-horse impatient to arrive at the goal;
      and, if you gazed yet; more earnestly, you might observe part of a high
      waterfall glimmering through the foliage, and giving occasion, doubtless,
      to the precipitate speed of the brook. Lower down, the stream became more
      placid, and opened into a quiet piece of water which afforded a rude haven
      to two or three fishermen&rsquo;s boats, then lying high and dry on the sand,
      the tide being out. Two or three miserable huts could be seen beside this
      little haven, inhabited probably by the owners of the boats, but inferior
      in every respect to the establishment of mine host, though that was
      miserable enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had but a minute or two to make these observations, yet during that
      space my companion showed symptoms of impatience, and more than once
      shouted, &lsquo;Cristal&mdash;Cristal Nixon,&rsquo; until the old man of the preceding
      evening appeared at the door of one of the neighbouring cottages or
      outhouses, leading the strong black horse which I before commemorated,
      ready bridled and saddled. My conductor made Cristal a sign with his
      finger, and, turning from the cottage door, led the way up the steep path
      or ravine which connected the sequestered dell with the open country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had I been perfectly aware of the character of the road down which I had
      been hurried with so much impetuosity on the preceding evening, I greatly
      question if I should have ventured the descent; for it deserved no better
      name than the channel of a torrent, now in a good measure filled with
      water, that dashed in foam and fury into the dell, being swelled with the
      rains of the preceding night. I ascended this ugly path with some
      difficulty although on foot, and felt dizzy when I observed, from such
      traces as the rains had not obliterated, that the horse seemed almost to
      have slid down it upon his haunches the evening before.
    </p>
    <p>
      My host threw himself on his horse&rsquo;s back, without placing a foot in the
      stirrup&mdash;passed me in the perilous ascent, against which he pressed
      his steed as if the animal had had the footing of a wild cat. The water
      and mud splashed from his heels in his reckless course, and a few bounds
      placed him on the top of the bank, where I presently joined him, and found
      the horse and rider standing still as a statue; the former panting and
      expanding his broad nostrils to the morning wind, the latter motionless,
      with his eye fixed on the first beams of the rising sun, which already
      began to peer above the eastern horizon and gild the distant mountains of
      Cumberland and Liddesdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed in a reverie, from which he started at my approach, and, putting
      his horse in motion, led the way at a leisurely pace through a broken and
      sandy road, which traversed a waste, level, and uncultivated tract of
      downs, intermixed with morass, much like that in the neighbourhood of my
      quarters at Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush. Indeed, the whole open ground of this
      district, where it approaches the sea, has, except in a few favoured
      spots, the same uniform and dreary character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Advancing about a hundred yards from the brink of the glen, we gained a
      still more extensive command of this desolate prospect, which seemed even
      more dreary, as contrasted with the opposite shores of Cumberland, crossed
      and intersected by ten thousand lines of trees growing in hedgerows,
      shaded with groves and woods of considerable extent, animated by hamlets
      and villas, from which thin clouds of smoke already gave sign of human
      life and human industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      My conductor had extended his arm, and was pointing the road to Shepherd&rsquo;s
      Bush, when the step of a horse was heard approaching us. He looked sharply
      round, and having observed who was approaching, proceeded in his
      instructions to me, planting himself at the same time in the very middle
      of the path, which, at the place where we halted, had a slough on the one
      side and a sandbank on the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      I observed that the rider who approached us slackened his horse&rsquo;s pace
      from a slow trot to a walk, as if desirous to suffer us to proceed, or at
      least to avoid passing us at a spot where the difficulty of doing so must
      have brought us very close to each other. You know my old failing, Alan,
      and that I am always willing to attend to anything in preference to the
      individual who has for the time possession of the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Agreeably to this amiable propensity, I was internally speculating
      concerning the cause of the rider keeping aloof from us, when my
      companion, elevating his deep voice so suddenly and so sternly as at once
      to recall my wandering thoughts, exclaimed, &lsquo;In the name of the devil,
      young man, do you think that others have no better use for their time than
      you have, that you oblige me to repeat the same thing to you three times
      over? Do you see, I say, yonder thing at a mile&rsquo;s distance, that looks
      like a finger-post, or rather like a gallows? I would it had a dreaming
      fool hanging upon it, as an example to all meditative moon-calves!&mdash;Yon
      gibbet-looking pole will guide you to the bridge, where you must pass the
      large brook; then proceed straight forwards, till several roads divide at
      a cairn. Plague on thee, thou art wandering again!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is indeed quite true that at this moment the horseman approached us,
      and my attention was again called to him as I made way to let him pass.
      His whole exterior at once showed that he belonged to the Society of
      Friends, or, as the world and the world&rsquo;s law calls them, Quakers. A
      strong and useful iron-grey galloway showed, by its sleek and good
      condition, that the merciful man was merciful to his beast. His
      accoutrements were in the usual unostentatious but clean and servicable
      order which characterizes these sectaries. His long surtout of dark-grey
      superfine cloth descended down to the middle of his leg, and was buttoned
      up to his chin, to defend him against the morning air. As usual, his ample
      beaver hung down without button or loop, and shaded a comely and placid
      countenance, the gravity of which appeared to contain some seasoning of
      humour, and had nothing in common with the pinched puritanical air
      affected by devotees in general. The brow was open and free from wrinkles,
      whether of age or hypocrisy. The eye was clear, calm, and considerate, yet
      appeared to be disturbed by apprehension, not to say fear, as, pronouncing
      the usual salutation of, &lsquo;I wish thee a good morrow, friend,&rsquo; he
      indicated, by turning his palfrey close to one side of the path, a wish to
      glide past us with as little trouble as possible&mdash;just as a traveller
      would choose to pass a mastiff of whose peaceable intentions he is by no
      means confident.
    </p>
    <p>
      But my friend, not meaning, perhaps, that he should get off so easily, put
      his horse quite across the path, so that, without plunging into the
      slough, or scrambling up the bank, the Quaker could not have passed him.
      Neither of these was an experiment without hazard greater than the
      passenger seemed willing to incur. He halted, therefore, as if waiting
      till my companion should make way for him; and, as they sat fronting each
      other, I could not help thinking that they might have formed no bad emblem
      of Peace and War; for although my conductor was unarmed, yet the whole of
      his manner, his stern look, and his upright seat on horseback, were
      entirely those of a soldier in undress, He accosted the Quaker in these
      words, &lsquo;So ho! friend Joshua, thou art early to the road this morning. Has
      the spirit moved thee and thy righteous brethren to act with some honesty,
      and pull down yonder tide-nets that keep the fish from coming up the
      river?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Surely, friend, not so,&rsquo; answered Joshua, firmly, but good-humouredly at
      the same time; &lsquo;thou canst not expect that our own hands should pull down
      what our purses established. Thou killest the fish with spear, line, and
      coble-net; and we, with snares and with nets, which work by the ebb and
      the flow of the tide. Each doth what seems best in his eyes to secure a
      share of the blessing which Providence hath bestowed on the river, and
      that within his own bounds. I prithee seek no quarrel against us, for thou
      shalt have no wrong at our hand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be assured I will take none at the hand of any man, whether his hat be
      cocked or broad-brimmed,&rsquo; answered the fisherman. &lsquo;I tell you in fair
      terms, Joshua Geddes, that you and your partners are using unlawful craft
      to destroy the fish in the Solway by stake-nets and wears; and that we,
      who fish fairly, and like men, as our fathers did, have daily and yearly
      less sport and less profit. Do not think gravity or hypocrisy can carry it
      off as you have done. The world knows you, and we know you. You will
      destroy the salmon which makes the livelihood of fifty poor families, and
      then wipe your mouth, and go to make a speech at meeting. But do not hope
      it will last thus. I give you fair warning, we will be upon you one
      morning soon, when we will not leave a stake standing in the pools of the
      Solway; and down the tide they shall every one go, and well if we do not
      send a lessee along with them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Friend,&rsquo; replied Joshua, with a constrained smile, &lsquo;but that I know thou
      dost not mean as thou sayst, I would tell thee we are under the protection
      of this country&rsquo;s laws; nor do we the less trust to obtain their
      protection, that our principles permit us not, by any act of violent
      resistance, to protect ourselves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All villainous cant and cowardice,&rsquo; exclaimed the fisherman, &lsquo;and assumed
      merely as a cloak to your hypocritical avarice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, say not cowardice, my friend,&rsquo; answered the Quaker, &lsquo;since thou
      knowest there may be as much courage in enduring as in acting; and I will
      be judged by this youth, or by any one else, whether there is not more
      cowardice&mdash;even in the opinion of that world whose thoughts are the
      breath in thy nostrils&mdash;in the armed oppressor who doth injury, than
      in the defenceless and patient sufferer who endureth it with constancy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will change no more words with you on the subject,&rsquo; said the fisherman,
      who, as if something moved at the last argument which Mr. Geddes had used,
      now made room for him to pass forward on his journey. &lsquo;Do not forget,
      however,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;that you have had fair warning, nor suppose that we
      will accept of fair words in apology for foul play. These nets of yours
      are unlawful&mdash;they spoil our fishings&mdash;we will have them down at
      all risks and hazards. I am a man of my word, friend Joshua.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I trust thou art,&rsquo; said the Quaker; &lsquo;but thou art the rather bound to be
      cautious in rashly affirming what thou wilt never execute. For I tell
      thee, friend, that though there is as great a difference between thee and
      one of our people as there is between a lion and a sheep, yet I know and
      believe thou hast so much of the lion in thee, that thou wouldst scarce
      employ thy strength and thy rage upon that which professeth no means of
      resistance. Report says so much good of thee, at least, if it says little
      more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Time will try,&rsquo; answered the fisherman; &lsquo;and hark thee, Joshua, before we
      part I will put thee in the way of doing one good deed, which, credit me,
      is better than twenty moral speeches. Here is a stranger youth, whom
      Heaven has so scantily gifted with brains, that he will bewilder himself
      in the Sands, as he did last night, unless thou wilt kindly show him the
      way to Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush; for I have been in vain endeavouring to make him
      comprehend the road thither. Hast thou so much charity under thy
      simplicity, Quaker, as to do this good turn?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, it is thou, friend,&rsquo; answered Joshua, &lsquo;that dost lack charity, to
      suppose any one unwilling to do so simple a kindness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thou art right&mdash;I should have remembered it can cost thee nothing.
      Young gentlemen, this pious pattern of primitive simplicity will teach
      thee the right way to the Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush&mdash;aye, and will himself
      shear thee like a sheep, if you come to buying and selling with him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He then abruptly asked me, how long I intended to remain at Shepherd&rsquo;s
      Bush.
    </p>
    <p>
      I replied, I was at present uncertain&mdash;as long probably, as I could
      amuse myself in the neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are fond of sport?&rsquo; he added, in the same tone of brief inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      I answered in the affirmative, but added, I was totally inexperienced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps if you reside here for some days,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;we may meet again,
      and I may have the chance of giving you a lesson.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ere I could express either thanks or assent, he turned short round with a
      wave of his hand by way of adieu, and rode back to the verge of the dell
      from which we had emerged together; and as he remained standing upon the
      banks, I could long hear his voice while he shouted down to those within
      its recesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the Quaker and I proceeded on our journey for some time in
      silence; he restraining his sober-minded steed to a pace which might have
      suited a much less active walker than myself, and looking on me from time
      to time with an expression of curiosity, mingled with benignity. For my
      part, I cared not to speak first. It happened I had never before been in
      company with one of this particular sect, and, afraid that in addressing
      him I might unwittingly infringe upon some of their prejudices or
      peculiarities, I patiently remained silent. At length he asked me, whether
      I had been long in the service of the laird, as men called him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I repeated the words &lsquo;in his service?&rsquo; with such an accent of surprise, as
      induced him to say, &lsquo;Nay, but, friend, I mean no offence; perhaps I should
      have said in his society&mdash;an inmate, I mean, in his house?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am totally unknown to the person from whom we have just parted,&rsquo; said
      I, &lsquo;and our connexion is only temporary. He had the charity to give me his
      guidance from the Sands, and a night&rsquo;s harbourage from the tempest. So our
      acquaintance began, and there it is likely to end; for you may observe
      that our friend is by no means apt to encourage familiarity.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So little so,&rsquo; answered my companion, &lsquo;that thy case is, I think, the
      first in which I ever heard of his receiving any one into his house; that
      is, if thou hast really spent the night there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why should you doubt it?&rsquo; replied I; &lsquo;there is no motive I can have to
      deceive you, nor is the object worth it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be not angry with me,&rsquo; said the Quaker; &lsquo;but thou knowest that thine own
      people do not, as we humbly endeavour to do, confine themselves within the
      simplicity of truth, but employ the language of falsehood, not only for
      profit, but for compliment, and sometimes for mere diversion. I have heard
      various stories of my neighbour; of most of which I only believe a small
      part, and even then they are difficult to reconcile with each other. But
      this being the first time I ever beard of his receiving a stranger within
      his dwelling, made me express some doubts. I pray thee let them not offend
      thee.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He does not,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;appear to possess in much abundance the means of
      exercising hospitality, and so may be excused from offering it in ordinary
      cases.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is to say, friend,&rsquo; replied Joshua, &lsquo;thou hast supped ill, and
      perhaps breakfasted worse. Now my small tenement, called Mount Sharon, is
      nearer to us by two miles than thine inn; and although going thither may
      prolong thy walk, as taking thee of the straighter road to Shepherd&rsquo;s
      Bush, yet methinks exercise will suit thy youthful limbs, as well as a
      good plain meal thy youthful appetite. What sayst thou, my young
      acquaintance?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it puts you not to inconvenience,&rsquo; I replied; for the invitation was
      cordially given, and my bread and milk had been hastily swallowed, and in
      small quantity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said Joshua, &lsquo;use not the language of compliment with those who
      renounce it. Had this poor courtesy been very inconvenient, perhaps I had
      not offered it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I accept the invitation, then,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;in the same good spirit in which
      you give it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Quaker smiled, reached me his hand, I shook it, and we travelled on in
      great cordiality with each other. The fact is, I was much entertained by
      contrasting in my own mind, the open manner of the kind-hearted Joshua
      Geddes, with the abrupt, dark, and lofty demeanour of my entertainer on
      the preceding evening. Both were blunt and unceremonious; but the
      plainness of the Quaker had the character of devotional simplicity, and
      was mingled with the more real kindness, as if honest Joshua was desirous
      of atoning, by his sincerity, for the lack of external courtesy. On the
      contrary, the manners of the fisherman were those of one to whom the rules
      of good behaviour might be familiar, but who, either from pride or
      misanthropy, scorned to observe them. Still I thought of him with interest
      and curiosity, notwithstanding so much about him that was repulsive; and I
      promised myself, in the course of my conversation with the Quaker, to
      learn all that he knew on the subject. He turned the conversation,
      however, into a different channel, and inquired into my own condition of
      life, and views in visiting this remote frontier.
    </p>
    <p>
      I only thought it necessary to mention my name, and add, that I had been
      educated to the law, but finding myself possessed of some independence, I
      had of late permitted myself some relaxation, and was residing at
      Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush to enjoy the pleasure of angling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do thee no harm, young man,&rsquo; said my new friend, &lsquo;in wishing thee a
      better employment for thy grave hours, and a more humane amusement (if
      amusement thou must have) for those of a lighter character.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are severe, sir,&rsquo; I replied. &lsquo;I heard you but a moment since refer
      yourself to the protection of the laws of the country&mdash;if there be
      laws, there must be lawyers to explain, and judges to administer them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Joshua smiled, and pointed to the sheep which were grazing on the downs
      over which we were travelling. &lsquo;Were a wolf,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;to come even now
      upon yonder flocks, they would crowd for protection, doubtless, around the
      shepherd and his dogs; yet they are bitten and harassed daily by the one,
      shorn, and finally killed and eaten by the other. But I say not this to
      shock you; for, though laws and lawyers are evils, yet they are necessary
      evils in this probationary state of society, till man shall learn to
      render unto his fellows that which is their due, according to the light of
      his own conscience, and through no other compulsion. Meanwhile, I have
      known many righteous men who have followed thy intended profession in
      honesty and uprightness of walk. The greater their merit, who walk erect
      in a path which so many find slippery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And angling,&rsquo; said I:&mdash;&lsquo;you object to that also as an amusement, you
      who, if I understood rightly what passed between you and my late landlord,
      are yourself a proprietor of fisheries.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a proprietor,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;I am only, in copartnery with others, a
      tacksman or lessee of some valuable salmon-fisheries a little down the
      coast. But mistake me not. The evil of angling, with which I class all
      sports, as they are called, which have the sufferings of animals for their
      end and object, does not consist in the mere catching and killing those
      animals with which the bounty of Providence hath stocked the earth for the
      good of man, but in making their protracted agony a principle of delight
      and enjoyment. I do indeed cause these fisheries to be conducted for the
      necessary taking, killing, and selling the fish; and, in the same way,
      were I a farmer, I should send my lambs to market. But I should as soon
      think of contriving myself a sport and amusement out of the trade of the
      butcher as out of that of the fisher.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We argued the point no further; for though I thought his arguments a
      little too high-strained, yet as my mind acquitted me of having taken
      delight in aught but the theory of field-sports, I did not think myself
      called upon stubbornly to advocate a practice which had afforded me so
      little pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had by this time arrived at the remains of an old finger-post, which my
      host had formerly pointed out as a landmark. Here, a ruinous wooden
      bridge, supported by long posts resembling crutches, served me to get
      across the water, while my new friend sought a ford a good way higher up,
      for the stream was considerably swelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I paused for his rejoining me, I observed an angler at a little
      distance pouching trout after trout, as fast almost as he could cast his
      line; and I own, in spite of Joshua&rsquo;s lecture on humanity, I could not but
      envy his adroitness and success, so natural is the love of sport to our
      minds, or so easily are we taught to assimilate success in field-sports
      with ideas of pleasure, and with the praise due to address and agility. I
      soon recognized in the successful angler little Benjie, who had been my
      guide and tutor in that gentle art, as you have learned from my former
      letters. I called&mdash;I whistled&mdash;the rascal recognized me, and,
      starting like a guilty thing, seemed hesitating whether to approach or to
      run away; and when he determined on the former, it was to assail me with a
      loud, clamorous, and exaggerated report of the anxiety of all at the
      Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush for my personal safety; how my landlady had wept, how Sam
      and the ostler had not the heart to go to bed, but sat up all night
      drinking&mdash;and how he himself had been up long before daybreak to go
      in quest of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you were switching the water, I suppose,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;to discover my
      dead body?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This observation produced a long &lsquo;Na&mdash;a&mdash;a&rsquo; of acknowledged
      detection; but, with his natural impudence, and confidence in my good
      nature, he immediately added, &lsquo;that he thought I would like a fresh trout
      or twa for breakfast, and the water being in such a rare trim for the
      saumon raun, [The bait made of salmon-roe salted and preserved. In a
      swollen river, and about the month of October, it is a most deadly bait.]
      he couldna help taking a cast.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      While we were engaged in this discussion, the honest Quaker returned to
      the farther end of the wooden bridge to tell me he could not venture to
      cross the brook in its present state: but would be under the necessity to
      ride round by the stone bridge, which was a mile and a half higher up than
      his own house. He was about to give me directions how to proceed without
      him, and inquire for his sister, when I suggested to him that, if he
      pleased to trust his horse to little Benjie, the boy might carry him round
      by the bridge, while we walked the shorter and more pleasant road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joshua shook his head, for he was well acquainted with Benjie, who, he
      said, was the naughtiest varlet in the whole neighbourhood. Nevertheless,
      rather than part company, he agreed to put the pony under his charge for a
      short season, with many injunctions that he should not attempt to mount,
      but lead the pony (even Solomon) by the bridle, under the assurances of
      sixpence in case of proper demeanour, and penalty that if he transgressed
      the orders given him, &lsquo;verily he would be scourged.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Promises cost Benjie nothing, and he showered them out wholesale; till the
      Quaker at length yielded up the bridle to him, repeating his charges, and
      enforcing them by holding up his forefinger. On my part, I called to
      Benjie to leave the fish he had taken at Mount Sharon, making, at the same
      time, an apologetic countenance to my new friend, not being quite aware
      whether the compliment would be agreeable to such a condemner of
      field-sports.
    </p>
    <p>
      He understood me at once, and reminded me of the practical distinction
      betwixt catching the animals as an object of cruel and wanton sport, and
      eating them as lawful and gratifying articles of food, after they were
      killed. On the latter point he had no scruples; but, on the contrary,
      assured me that this brook contained the real red trout, so highly
      esteemed by all connoisseurs, and that, when eaten within an hour of their
      being caught, they had a peculiar firmness of substance and delicacy of
      flavour, which rendered them an agreeable addition to a morning meal,
      especially when earned, like ours, by early rising, and an hour or two&rsquo;s
      wholesome exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to thy alarm be it spoken, Alan, we did not come so far as the frying
      of our fish without further adventure. So it is only to spare thy
      patience, and mine own eyes, that I pull up for the present, and send thee
      the rest of my story in a subsequent letter.

    <h2>
      LETTER VII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE SAME TO THE SAME (In continuation.)
    </h3>
    <p>
      Little Benjie, with the pony, having been sent off on the left side of the
      brook, the Quaker and I sauntered on, like the cavalry and infantry of the
      same army occupying the opposite banks of a river, and observing the same
      line of march. But, while my worthy companion was assuring me of a
      pleasant greensward walk to his mansion, little Benjie, who had been
      charged to keep in sight, chose to deviate from the path assigned him,
      and, turning to the right, led his charge, Solomon, out of our vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The villain means to mount him!&rsquo; cried Joshua, with more vivacity than
      was consistent with his profession of passive endurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I endeavoured to appease his apprehensions, as he pushed on, wiping his
      brow with vexation, assuring him that, if the boy did mount, he would, for
      his own sake, ride gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You do not know him,&rsquo; said Joshua, rejecting all consolation; &lsquo;HE do
      anything gently!&mdash;no, he will gallop Solomon&mdash;he will misuse the
      sober patience of the poor animal who has borne me so long! Yes, I was
      given over to my own devices when I ever let him touch the bridle, for
      such a little miscreant there never was before him in this country.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He then proceeded to expatiate on every sort of rustic enormity of which
      he accused Benjie. He had been suspected of snaring partridges&mdash;was
      detected by Joshua himself in liming singing-birds&mdash;stood fully
      charged with having worried several cats, by aid of a lurcher which
      attended him, and which was as lean, and ragged, and mischievous, as his
      master. Finally, Benjie stood accused of having stolen a duck, to hunt it
      with the said lurcher, which was as dexterous on water as on land. I
      chimed in with my friend, in order to avoid giving him further irritation,
      and declared I should be disposed, from my own experience, to give up
      Benjie as one of Satan&rsquo;s imps. Joshua Geddes began to censure the phrase
      as too much exaggerated, and otherwise unbecoming the mouth of a
      reflecting person; and, just as I was apologizing for it, as being a term
      of common parlance, we heard certain sounds on the opposite side of the
      brook, which seemed to indicate that Solomon and Benjie were at issue
      together. The sandhills behind which Benjie seemed to take his course, had
      concealed from us, as doubtless he meant they should, his ascent into the
      forbidden saddle, and, putting Solomon to his mettle, which he was seldom
      called upon to exert, they had cantered away together in great amity, till
      they came near to the ford from which the palfrey&rsquo;s legitimate owner had
      already turned back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here a contest of opinions took place between the horse and his rider. The
      latter, according to his instructions, attempted to direct Solomon towards
      the distant bridge of stone; but Solomon opined that the ford was the
      shortest way to his own stable. The point was sharply contested, and we
      heard Benjie gee-hupping, tchek-tcheking, and, above all, flogging in
      great style; while Solomon, who, docile in his general habits, was now
      stirred beyond his patience, made a great trampling and recalcitration;
      and it was their joint noise which we heard, without being able to see,
      though Joshua might too well guess, the cause of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alarmed at these indications, the Quaker began to shout out, &lsquo;Benjie&mdash;thou
      varlet! Solomon&mdash;thou fool!&rsquo; when the couple presented themselves in
      full drive, Solomon having now decidedly obtained the better of the
      conflict, and bringing his unwilling rider in high career down to the
      ford. Never was there anger changed so fast into humane fear, as that of
      my good companion. &lsquo;The varlet will be drowned!&rsquo; he exclaimed&mdash;&lsquo;a
      widow&rsquo;s son!&mdash;her only son!&mdash;and drowned!&mdash;let me go&rsquo;&mdash;And
      he struggled with me stoutly as I hung upon him, to prevent him from
      plunging into the ford.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had no fear whatever for Benjie; for the blackguard vermin, though he
      could not manage the refractory horse, stuck on his seat like a monkey.
      Solomon and Benjie scrambled through the ford with little inconvenience,
      and resumed their gallop on the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to guess whether on this last occasion Benjie was
      running off with Solomon, or Solomon with Benjie; but, judging from
      character and motives, I rather suspected the former. I could not help
      laughing as the rascal passed me, grinning betwixt terror and delight,
      perched on the very pommel of the saddle, and holding with extended arms
      by bridle and mane while Solomon, the bit secured between his teeth, and
      his head bored down betwixt his forelegs, passed his master in this
      unwonted guise as hard as he could pelt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The mischievous bastard!&rsquo; exclaimed the Quaker, terrified out of his
      usual moderation of speech&mdash;&lsquo;the doomed gallows-bird!&mdash;he will
      break Solomon&rsquo;s wind to a certainty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I prayed him to be comforted&mdash;assured, him a brushing gallop would do
      his favourite no harm and reminded him of the censure he had bestowed on
      me a minute before, for applying a harsh epithet to the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Joshua was not without his answer; &lsquo;Friend youth,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;thou
      didst speak of the lad&rsquo;s soul, which thou didst affirm belonged to the
      enemy, and of that thou couldst say nothing of thine own knowledge; on the
      contrary, I did but speak of his outward man, which will assuredly be
      suspended by a cord, if he mendeth not his manners. Men say that, young as
      he is, he is one of the laird&rsquo;s gang.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of the laird&rsquo;s gang!&rsquo; said I, repeating the words in surprise. &lsquo;Do you
      mean the person with whom I slept last night? I heard you call him the
      laird. Is he at the head of a gang?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, I meant not precisely a gang,&rsquo; said the Quaker, who appeared in his
      haste to have spoken more than he intended&mdash;a company, or party, I
      should have said; but thus it is, friend Latimer, with the wisest men when
      they permit themselves to be perturbed with passion, and speak as in a
      fever, or as with the tongue of the foolish and the forward. And although
      thou hast been hasty to mark my infirmity, yet I grieve not that thou hast
      been a witness to it, seeing that the stumbles of the wise may be no less
      a caution to youth and inexperience, than is the fall of the foolish.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a sort of acknowledgement of what I had already begun to suspect&mdash;that
      my new friend&rsquo;s real goodness of disposition, joined to the acquired
      quietism of his religious sect, had been unable entirely to check the
      effervescence of a temper naturally warm and hasty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the present occasion, as if sensible he had displayed a greater
      degree of emotion than became his character, Joshua avoided further
      allusion to Benjie and Solomon, and proceeded to solicit my attention to
      the natural objects around us, which increased in beauty and interest, as,
      still conducted by the meanders of the brook, we left the common behind
      us, and entered a more cultivated and enclosed country, where arable and
      pasture ground was agreeably varied with groves and hedges. Descending now
      almost close to the stream, our course lay through a little gate, into a
      pathway kept with great neatness, the sides of which were decorated with
      trees and flowering shrubs of the hardier species; until, ascending by a
      gentle slope, we issued from the grove, and stood almost at once in front
      of a low but very neat building, of an irregular form; and my guide,
      shaking me cordially by the hand, made me welcome to Mount Sharon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wood through which we had approached this little mansion was thrown
      around it both on the north and north-west, but, breaking off into
      different directions, was intersected by a few fields well watered and
      sheltered. The house fronted to the south-east, and from thence the
      pleasure-ground, or, I should rather say, the gardens, sloped down to the
      water. I afterwards understood that the father of the present proprietor
      had a considerable taste for horticulture, which had been inherited by his
      son, and had formed these gardens, which, with their shaven turf, pleached
      alleys, wildernesses, and exotic trees and shrubs, greatly excelled
      anything of the kind which had been attempted in the neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there was a little vanity in the complacent smile with which Joshua
      Geddes saw me gaze with delight on a scene so different from the naked
      waste we had that day traversed in company, it might surely be permitted
      to one who, cultivating and improving the beauties of nature, had found
      therein, as he said, bodily health, and a pleasing relaxation for the
      mind. At the bottom of the extended gardens the brook wheeled round in a
      wide semicircle, and was itself their boundary. The opposite side was no
      part of Joshua&rsquo;s domain, but the brook was there skirted by a precipitous
      rock of limestone, which seemed a barrier of nature&rsquo;s own erecting around
      his little Eden of beauty, comfort, and peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I must not let thee forget,&rsquo; said the kind Quaker, &lsquo;amidst thy
      admiration of these beauties of our little inheritance, that thy breakfast
      has been a light one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Joshua conducted me to a small sashed door, opening under a
      porch amply mantled by honeysuckle and clematis, into a parlour of
      moderate size; the furniture of which, in plainness and excessive
      cleanliness, bore the characteristic marks of the sect to which the owner
      belonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thy father&rsquo;s Hannah is generally allowed to be an exception to all
      Scottish housekeepers, and stands unparalleled for cleanliness among the
      women of Auld Reekie; but the cleanliness of Hannah is sluttishness
      compared to the scrupulous purifications of these people, who seem to
      carry into the minor decencies of life that conscientious rigour which
      they affect in their morals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parlour would have been gloomy, for the windows were small and the
      ceiling low; but the present proprietor had rendered it more cheerful by
      opening one end into a small conservatory, roofed with glass, and divided
      from the parlour by a partition of the same. I have never before seen this
      very pleasing manner of uniting the comforts of an apartment with the
      beauties of a garden, and I wonder it is not more practised by the great.
      Something of the kind is hinted at in a paper of the SPECTATOR.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I walked towards the conservatory to view it more closely, the parlour
      chimney engaged my attention. It was a pile of massive stone, entirely out
      of proportion to the size of the apartment. On the front had once been an
      armorial scutcheon; for the hammer, or chisel, which had been employed to
      deface the shield or crest, had left uninjured the scroll beneath, which
      bore the pious motto, &lsquo;TRUST IN GOD.&rsquo; Black-letter, you know, was my early
      passion, and the tombstones in the Greyfriars&rsquo; churchyard early yielded up
      to my knowledge as a decipherer what little they could tell of the
      forgotten dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joshua Geddes paused when he saw my eye fixed on this relic of antiquity.
      &lsquo;Thou canst read it?&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I repeated the motto, and added, there seemed vestiges of a date.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It should be 1537,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;for so long ago, at the least computation,
      did my ancestors, in the blinded times of Papistry, possess these lands,
      and in that year did they build their house.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is an ancient descent,&rsquo; said I, looking with respect upon the
      monument. &lsquo;I am sorry the arms have been defaced.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was perhaps impossible for my friend, Quaker as he was, to seem
      altogether void of respect for the pedigree which he began to recount to
      me, disclaiming all the while the vanity usually connected with the
      subject; in short, with the air of mingled melancholy, regret, and
      conscious dignity, with which Jack Fawkes used to tell us at college of
      his ancestor&rsquo;s unfortunate connexion with the Gunpowder Plot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher,&rsquo; thus harangued Joshua Gleddes of
      Mount Sharon; &lsquo;if we ourselves are nothing in the sight of Heaven, how
      much less than nothing must be our derivation from rotten bones and
      mouldering dust, whose immortal spirits have long since gone to their
      private account? Yes, friend Latimer, my ancestors were renowned among the
      ravenous and bloodthirsty men who then dwelt in this vexed country; and so
      much were they famed for successful freebooting, robbery, and bloodshed,
      that they are said to have been called Geddes, as likening them to the
      fish called a Jack, Pike, or Luce, and in our country tongue, a GED&mdash;a
      goodly distinction truly for Christian men! Yet did they paint this shark
      of the fresh waters upon their shields, and these profane priests of a
      wicked idolatry, the empty boasters called heralds, who make engraven
      images of fishes, fowls, and four-footed beasts, that men may fall down
      and worship them, assigned the ged for the device and escutcheon of my
      fathers, and hewed it over their chimneys, and placed it above their
      tombs; and the men were elated in mind, and became yet more ged-like,
      slaying, leading into captivity, and dividing the spoil, until the place
      where they dwelt obtained the name of Sharing-Knowe, from the booty which
      was there divided amongst them and their accomplices. But a better
      judgement was given to my father&rsquo;s father, Philip Geddes, who, after
      trying to light his candle at some of the vain wildfires then held aloft
      at different meetings and steeple-houses, at length obtained a spark from
      the lamp of the blessed George Fox, who came into Scotland spreading light
      among darkness, as he himself hath written, as plentifully as fly the
      sparkles from the hoof of the horse which gallops swiftly along the stony
      road.&rsquo;&mdash;Here the good Quaker interrupted himself with, &lsquo;And that is
      very true, I must go speedily to see after the condition of Solomon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A Quaker servant here entered the room with a tray, and inclining his head
      towards his master, but not after the manner of one who bows, said
      composedly, &lsquo;Thou art welcome home, friend Joshua, we expected thee not so
      early; but what hath befallen Solomon thy horse?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What hath befallen him, indeed?&rsquo; said my friend; &lsquo;hath he not been
      returned hither by the child whom they call Benjie?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He hath,&rsquo; said his domestic, &lsquo;but it was after a strange fashion; for he
      came hither at a swift and furious pace, and flung the child Benjie from
      his back, upon the heap of dung which is in the stable-yard.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am glad of it,&rsquo; said Joshua, hastily,&mdash;&lsquo;glad of it, with all my
      heart and spirit! But stay, he is the child of the widow&mdash;hath the
      boy any hurt?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not so&rsquo; answered the servant, &lsquo;for he rose and fled swiftly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Joshua muttered something about a scourge, and then inquired after
      Solomon&rsquo;s present condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He seetheth like a steaming cauldron,&rsquo; answered the servant; &lsquo;and
      Bauldie, the lad, walketh him about the yard with a halter, lest he take
      cold.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Geddes hastened to the stable-yard to view personally the condition of
      his favourite, and I followed to offer my counsel as a jockey. Don&rsquo;t
      laugh, Alan, sure I have jockeyship enough to assist a Quaker&mdash;in
      this unpleasing predicament.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lad who was leading the horse seemed to be no Quaker, though his
      intercourse with the family had given him a touch of their prim sobriety
      of look and manner. He assured Joshua that his horse had received no
      injury, and I even hinted that the exercise would be of service to him.
      Solomon himself neighed towards his master, and rubbed his head against
      the good Quaker&rsquo;s shoulder, as if to assure him of his being quite well;
      so that Joshua returned in comfort to his parlour, where breakfast was now
      about to be displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have since learned that the affection of Joshua for his pony is
      considered as inordinate by some of his own sect; and that he has been
      much blamed for permitting it to be called by the name of Solomon, or any
      other name whatever; but he has gained so much respect and influence among
      them that they overlook these foibles.
    </p>
    <p>
      I learned from him (whilst the old servant, Jehoiachim, entering and
      re-entering, seemed to make no end of the materials which he brought in
      for breakfast) that his grandfather Philip, the convert of George Fox, had
      suffered much from the persecution to which these harmless devotees were
      subjected on all sides during that intolerant period, and much of their
      family estate had been dilapidated. But better days dawned on Joshua&rsquo;s
      father, who, connecting himself by marriage with a wealthy family of
      Quakers in Lancashire, engaged successfully in various branches of
      commerce, and redeemed the remnants of the property, changing its name in
      sense, without much alteration of sound, from the Border appellation of
      Sharing-Knowe, to the evangelical appellation of Mount Sharon.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Philip Geddes, as I before hinted, had imbibed the taste for
      horticulture and the pursuits of the florist, which are not uncommon among
      the peaceful sect he belonged to. He had destroyed the remnants of the old
      peel-house, substituting the modern mansion in its place; and while he
      reserved the hearth of his ancestors, in memory of their hospitality, as
      also the pious motto which they had chanced to assume, he failed not to
      obliterate the worldly and military emblems displayed upon the shield and
      helmet, together with all their blazonry.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes after Mr. Geddes had concluded the account; of himself
      and his family, his sister Rachel, the only surviving member of it,
      entered the room. Her appearance is remarkably pleasing, and although her
      age is certainly thirty at least, she still retains the shape and motion
      of an earlier period. The absence of everything like fashion or ornament
      was, as usual, atoned for by the most perfect neatness and cleanliness of
      her dress; and her simple close cap was particularly suited to eyes which
      had the softness and simplicity of the dove&rsquo;s. Her features were also
      extremely agreeable, but had suffered a little through the ravages of that
      professed enemy to beauty, the small-pox; a disadvantage which was in part
      counterbalanced by a well-formed mouth, teeth like pearls, and a pleasing
      sobriety of smile, that seemed to wish good here and hereafter to every
      one she spoke to. You cannot make any of your vile inferences here, Alan,
      for I have given a full-length picture of Rachel Geddes; so that; you
      cannot say, in this case, as in the letter I have just received, that she
      was passed over as a subject on which I feared to dilate. More of this
      anon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, we settled to our breakfast after a blessing, or rather an extempore
      prayer, which Joshua made upon the occasion, and which the spirit moved
      him to prolong rather more than I felt altogether agreeable. Then, Alan,
      there was such a dispatching of the good things of the morning as you have
      not witnessed since you have seen Darsie Latimer at breakfast. Tea and
      chocolate, eggs, ham, and pastry, not forgetting the broiled fish,
      disappeared with a celerity which seemed to astonish the good-humoured
      Quakers, who kept loading my plate with supplies, as if desirous of seeing
      whether they could, by any possibility, tire me out. One hint, however, I
      received, which put me in mind where I was. Miss Geddes had offered me
      some sweet-cake, which, at the moment, I declined; but presently
      afterwards, seeing it within my reach, I naturally enough helped myself to
      a slice, and had just; deposited it beside my plate, when Joshua, mine
      host, not with the authoritative air of Sancho&rsquo;s doctor, Tirteafuera, but
      in a very calm and quiet manner, lifted it away and replaced it on the
      dish, observing only, &lsquo;Thou didst refuse it before, friend Latimer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      These good folks, Alan, make no allowance for what your good father calls
      the Aberdeen-man&rsquo;s privilege, of &lsquo;taking his word again;&rsquo; or what the wise
      call second thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bating this slight hint that I was among a precise generation, there was
      nothing in my reception that was peculiar&mdash;unless, indeed, I were to
      notice the solicitous and uniform kindness with which all the attentions
      of my new friends were seasoned, as if they were anxious to assure me that
      the neglect of worldly compliments interdicted by their sect, only served
      to render their hospitality more sincere. At length my hunger was
      satisfied, and the worthy Quaker, who, with looks of great good nature,
      had watched my progress, thus addressed his sister:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This young man, Rachel, hath last night sojourned in the tents of our
      neighbour whom men call the laird. I am sorry I had not met him the
      evening before, for our neighbour&rsquo;s hospitality is too unfrequently
      exercised to be well prepared with the means of welcome.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, but, Joshua,&rsquo; said Rachel, &lsquo;if our neighbour hath done a kindness,
      thou shouldst not grudge him the opportunity; and if our young friend hath
      fared ill for a night, he will the better relish what Providence may send
      him of better provisions.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And that he may do so at leisure,&rsquo; said Joshua, &lsquo;we will pray him,
      Rachel, to tarry a day or twain with us: he is young, and is but now
      entering upon the world, and our habitation may, if he will, be like a
      resting-place, from which he may look abroad upon the pilgrimage which he
      must take, and the path which he has to travel.&mdash;What sayest thou,
      friend Latimer? We constrain not our friends to our ways, and thou art, I
      think, too wise to quarrel with us for following our own fashions; and if
      we should even give thee a word of advice, thou wilt not, I think, be
      angry, so that it is spoken in season.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      You know, Alan, how easily I am determined by anything resembling
      cordiality&mdash;and so, though a little afraid of the formality of my
      host and hostess, I accepted their invitation, provided I could get some
      messenger to send to Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush for my servant and portmanteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, truly, friend,&rsquo; said Joshua, &lsquo;thy outward frame would be improved by
      cleaner garments; but I will do thine errand myself to the Widow Gregson&rsquo;s
      house of reception, and send thy lad hither with thy clothes. Meanwhile,
      Rachel will show thee these little gardens, and then will put thee in some
      way of spending thy time usefully, till our meal calls us together at the
      second hour after noon. I bid thee farewell for the present, having some
      space to walk, seeing I must leave the animal Solomon to his refreshing
      rest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words, Mr. Joshua Geddes withdrew. Some ladies we have known
      would have felt, or at least affected, reserve or embarrassment, at being
      left to do the honours of the grounds to (it will be out, Alan)&mdash;a
      smart young fellow&mdash;an entire stranger. She went out for a few
      minutes, and returned in her plain cloak and bonnet, with her beaver
      gloves, prepared to act as my guide, with as much simplicity as if she had
      been to wait upon thy father. So forth I sallied with my fair Quakeress.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the house at Mount Sharon be merely a plain and convenient dwelling, of
      moderate size and small pretensions, the gardens and offices, though not
      extensive, might rival an earl&rsquo;s in point of care and expense. Rachel
      carried me first to her own favourite resort, a poultry-yard, stocked with
      a variety of domestic fowls, of the more rare as well as the most ordinary
      kinds, furnished with every accommodation which may suit their various
      habits. A rivulet which spread into a pond for the convenience of the
      aquatic birds, trickled over gravel as it passed through the yards
      dedicated to the land poultry, which were thus amply supplied with the
      means they use for digestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these creatures seemed to recognize the presence of their mistress,
      and some especial favourites hastened to her feet, and continued to follow
      her as far as their limits permitted. She pointed out their peculiarities
      and qualities, with the discrimination of one who had made natural history
      her study; and I own I never looked on barn-door fowls with so much
      interest before&mdash;at least until they were boiled or roasted. I could
      not help asking the trying question, how she could order the execution of
      any of the creatures of which she seemed so careful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was painful,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;but it was according to the law of their
      being. They must die; but they knew not when death was approaching; and in
      making them comfortable while they lived, we contributed to their
      happiness as much as the conditions of their existence permitted to us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not quite of her mind, Alan. I do not believe either pigs or poultry
      would admit that the chief end of their being was to be killed and eaten.
      However, I did not press the argument, from which my Quaker seemed rather
      desirous to escape; for, conducting me to the greenhouse, which was
      extensive, and filled with the choicest plants, she pointed out an aviary
      which occupied the farther end, where, she said, she employed herself with
      attending the inhabitants, without being disturbed with any painful
      recollections concerning their future destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will not trouble you with any account of the various hot-houses and
      gardens, and their contents. No small sum of money must have been expended
      in erecting and maintaining them in the exquisite degree of good order
      which they exhibited. The family, I understood, were connected with that
      of the celebrated Millar, and had imbibed his taste for flowers, and for
      horticulture. But instead of murdering botanical names, I will rather
      conduct you to the POLICY, or pleasure-garden, which the taste of Joshua
      or his father had extended on the banks betwixt the house and river. This
      also, in contradistinction to the prevailing simplicity, was ornamented in
      an unusual degree. There were various compartments, the connexion of which
      was well managed, and although the whole ground did not exceed five or six
      acres, it was so much varied as to seem four times larger. The space
      contained close alleys and open walks; a very pretty artificial waterfall;
      a fountain also, consisting of a considerable jet-d&rsquo;eau, whose streams
      glittered in the sunbeams and exhibited a continual rainbow. There was a
      cabinet of verdure, as the French call it, to cool the summer heat, and
      there was a terrace sheltered from the north-east by a noble holly hedge,
      with all its glittering spears where you might have the full advantage of
      the sun in the clear frosty days of winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know that you, Alan, will condemn all this as bad and antiquated; for,
      ever since Dodsley has described the Leasowes, and talked of Brown&rsquo;s
      imitations of nature and Horace Walpole&rsquo;s late Essay on Gardening, you are
      all for simple nature&mdash;condemn walking up and down stairs in the open
      air and declare for wood and wilderness. But NE QUID NIMIS. I would not
      deface a scene of natural grandeur or beauty, by the introduction of
      crowded artificial decorations; yet such may, I think, be very
      interesting, where the situation, in its natural state, otherwise has no
      particular charms.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that when I have a country-house (who can say how soon?) you may look
      for grottoes, and cascades, and fountains; nay if you vex me by
      contradiction, perhaps I may go the length of a temple&mdash;so provoke me
      not, for you see of what enormities I am capable.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate, Alan, had you condemned as artificial the rest of Friend
      Geddes&rsquo;s grounds, there is a willow walk by the very verge of the stream,
      so sad, so solemn, and so silent, that it must have commanded your
      admiration. The brook, restrained at the ultimate boundary of the grounds
      by a natural dam-dike or ledge of rocks, seemed, even in its present
      swollen state, scarcely to glide along: and the pale willow-trees,
      dropping their long branches into the stream, gathered around them little
      coronals of the foam that floated down from the more rapid stream above.
      The high rock, which formed the opposite bank of the brook, was seen dimly
      through the branches, and its pale and splintered front, garlanded with
      long streamers of briers and other creeping plants, seemed a barrier
      between the quiet path which we trod, and the toiling and bustling world
      beyond. The path itself, following the sweep of the stream, made a very
      gentle curve; enough, however, served by its inflection completely to hide
      the end of the walk until you arrived at it. A deep and sullen sound,
      which increased as you proceeded, prepared you for this termination, which
      was indeed only a plain root-seat, from which you looked on a fall of
      about six or seven feet, where the brook flung itself over the ledge of
      natural rock I have already mentioned, which there crossed its course.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quiet and twilight seclusion of this walk rendered it a fit scene for
      confidential communing; and having nothing more interesting to say to my
      fair Quaker, I took the liberty of questioning her about the laird; for
      you are, or ought to be, aware, that next to discussing the affairs of the
      heart, the fair sex are most interested in those of their neighbours.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not conceal either my curiosity, or the check which it had received
      from Joshua, and I saw that my companion answered with embarrassment. &lsquo;I
      must not speak otherwise than truly,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;and therefore I tell
      thee, that my brother dislikes, and that I fear, the man of whom thou hast
      asked me. Perhaps we are both wrong&mdash;but he is a man of violence, and
      hath great influence over many, who, following the trade of sailors and
      fishermen, become as rude as the elements with which they contend. He hath
      no certain name among them, which is not unusual, their rude fashion being
      to distinguish each other by nicknames; and they have called him the Laird
      of the Lakes (not remembering there should be no one called Lord, save one
      only) in idle derision; the pools of salt water left by the tide among the
      sands being called the Lakes of Solway.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has he no other revenue than he derives from these sands?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That I cannot answer,&rsquo; replied Rachel; &lsquo;men say that he wants not money,
      though he lives like an ordinary fisherman, and that he imparts freely of
      his means to the poor around him. They intimate that he is a man of
      consequence, once deeply engaged in the unhappy affair of the rebellion,
      and even still too much in danger from the government to assume his own
      name. He is often absent from his cottage at Broken-burn-cliffs, for weeks
      and months.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should have thought,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;that the government would scarce, at
      this time of day, be likely to proceed against any one even of the most
      obnoxious rebels. Many years have passed away&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is true,&rsquo; she replied; &lsquo;yet such persons may understand that their
      being connived at depends on their living in obscurity. But indeed there
      can nothing certain be known among these rude people. The truth is not in
      them&mdash;most of them participate in the unlawful trade betwixt these
      parts and the neighbouring shore of England; and they are familiar with
      every species of falsehood and deceit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is a pity,&rsquo; I remarked, &lsquo;your brother should have neighbours of such a
      description, especially as I understand he is at some variance with them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where, when, and about what matter?&rsquo; answered Miss Geddes, with an eager
      and timorous anxiety, which made me regret having touched on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told her, in a way as little alarming as I could devise, the purport of
      what passed betwixt this Laird of the Lakes and her brother, at their
      morning&rsquo;s interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You affright me much,&rsquo; answered she; &lsquo;it is this very circumstance which
      has scared me in the watches of the night. When my brother Joshua withdrew
      from an active share in the commercial concerns of my father, being
      satisfied with the portion of worldly substance which he already
      possessed, there were one or two undertakings in which he retained an
      interest, either because his withdrawing might have been prejudicial to
      friends, or because he wished to retain some mode of occupying his time.
      Amongst the more important of these is a fishing station on the coast,
      where, by certain improved modes of erecting snares, opening at the
      advance of the tide, and shutting at the reflux, many more fish are taken
      than can be destroyed by those who, like the men of Broken-burn, use only
      the boat-net and spear, or fishing-rod. They complain of these tide-nets,
      as men call them, as an innovation, and pretend to a right to remove and
      destroy them by the strong hand. I fear me, this man of violence, whom
      they call the laird, will execute these his threats, which cannot be
      without both loss and danger to my brother.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Geddes,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;ought to apply to the civil, magistrate; there are
      soldiers at Dumfries who would be detached for his protection.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thou speakest, friend Latimer,&rsquo; answered the lady, &lsquo;as one who is still
      in the gall of bitterness and bond of iniquity. God forbid that we should
      endeavour to preserve nets of flax and stakes of wood, or the Mammon of
      gain which they procure for us, by the hands of men of war and at the risk
      of spilling human blood.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I respect your scruples,&rsquo; I replied; &lsquo;but since such is your way of
      thinking, your brother ought to avert the danger by compromise or
      submission.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps it would be best,&rsquo; answered Rachel; &lsquo;but what can I say? Even in
      the best-trained temper there may remain some leaven of the old Adam; and
      I know not whether it is this or a better spirit that maketh my brother
      Joshua determine, that though he will not resist force by force, neither
      will he yield up his right to mere threats, or encourage wrong to others
      by yielding to menaces. His partners, he says, confide in his steadiness:
      and that he must not disappoint them by yielding up their right for the
      fear of the threats of man, whose breath is in his nostrils.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This observation convinced me that the spirit of the old sharers of the
      spoil was not utterly departed even from the bosom of the peaceful Quaker;
      and I could not help confessing internally that Joshua had the right, when
      he averred that there was as much courage in sufferance as in exertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we approached the farther end of the willow walk, the sullen and
      continuous sound of the dashing waters became still more and more audible,
      and at length rendered it difficult for us to communicate with each other.
      The conversation dropped, but apparently my companion continued to dwell
      upon the apprehensions which it had excited. At the bottom of the walk we
      obtained a view of the cascade, where the swollen brook flung itself in
      foam and tumult over the natural barrier of rock, which seemed in vain to
      attempt to bar its course. I gazed with delight, and, turning to express
      my sentiment to my companion, I observed that she had folded her hands in
      an attitude of sorrowful resignation, which showed her thoughts were far
      from the scene which lay before her. When she saw that her abstraction was
      observed, she resumed her former placidity of manner; and having given me
      sufficient time to admire this termination of our sober and secluded walk,
      proposed that me should return to the house through her brother&rsquo;s farm.
      &lsquo;Even we Quakers, as we are called, have our little pride,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;and
      my brother Joshua would not forgive me, were I not to show thee the fields
      which he taketh delight to cultivate after the newest and best fashion;
      for which, I promise thee, he hath received much praise from good judges,
      as well as some ridicule from those who think it folly to improve on the
      customs of our ancestors.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, she opened a low door, leading through a moss and
      ivy-covered wall, the boundary of the pleasure-ground, into the open
      fields; through which we moved by a convenient path, leading, with good
      taste and simplicity, by stile and hedgerow, through pasturage, and
      arable, and woodland; so that in all ordinary weather, the good man might,
      without even soiling his shoes, perform his perambulation round the farm.
      There were seats also, on which to rest; and though not adorned with
      inscriptions, nor quite so frequent in occurrence as those mentioned in
      the account of the Leasowes, their situation was always chosen with
      respect to some distant prospect to be commanded, or some home-view to be
      enjoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what struck me most in Joshua&rsquo;s domain was the quantity and the
      tameness of the game. The hen partridge scarce abandoned the roost, at the
      foot of the hedge where she had assembled her covey, though the path went
      close beside her; and the hare, remaining on her form, gazed at us as we
      passed, with her full dark eye, or rising lazily and hopping to a little
      distance, stood erect to look at us with more curiosity than apprehension.
      I observed to Miss Geddes the extreme tameness of these timid and shy
      animals, and she informed me that their confidence arose from protection
      in the summer, and relief during the winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are pets,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;of my brother, who considers them as the
      better entitled to his kindness that they are a race persecuted by the
      world in general. He denieth himself,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;even the company of a
      dog, that these creatures may here at least enjoy undisturbed security.
      Yet this harmless or humane propensity, or humour, hath given offence,&rsquo; 
      she added, &lsquo;to our dangerous neighbours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She explained this, by telling me that my host of the preceding night was
      remarkable for his attachment to field-sports, which he pursued without
      much regard to the wishes of the individuals over whose property he
      followed them. The undefined mixture of respect and fear with which he was
      generally regarded induced most of the neighbouring land-holders to
      connive at what they would perhaps in another have punished as a trespass;
      but Joshua Geddes would not permit the intrusion of any one upon his
      premises, and as he had before offended several country neighbours, who,
      because he would neither shoot himself nor permit others to do so,
      compared him to the dog in the manger, so he now aggravated the
      displeasure which the Laird of the Lakes had already conceived against
      him, by positively debarring him from pursuing his sport over his grounds&mdash;&lsquo;So
      that,&rsquo; said Rachel Geddes, &lsquo;I sometimes wish our lot had been cast
      elsewhere than in these pleasant borders, where, if we had less of beauty
      around us, we might have had a neighbourhood of peace and, goodwill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We at length returned to the house, where Miss Geddes showed me a small
      study, containing a little collection of books, in two separate presses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;These,&rsquo; said she, pointing to the smaller press, &lsquo;will, if thou bestowest
      thy leisure upon them, do thee good; and these,&rsquo; pointing to the other and
      larger cabinet, &lsquo;can, I believe, do thee little harm. Some of our people
      do indeed hold, that every writer who is not with us is against us; but
      brother Joshua is mitigated in his opinions, and correspondeth with our
      friend John Scot of Amwell, who hath himself constructed verses well
      approved of even in the world. I wish thee many good thoughts till our
      family meet at the hour of dinner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Left alone, I tried both collections; the first consisted entirely of
      religious and controversial tracts, and the latter formed a small
      selection of history and of moral writers, both in prose and verse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither collection promising much amusement, thou hast, in these close
      pages, the fruits of my tediousness; and truly, I think, writing history
      (one&rsquo;s self being the subject) is as amusing as reading that of foreign
      countries, at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam, still more drunk than sober, arrived in due time with my portmanteau,
      and enabled me to put my dress into order, better befitting this temple of
      cleanliness and decorum, where (to conclude) I believe I shall be a
      sojourner more days than one. [See Note 1.]
    </p>
    <p>
      PS.&mdash;I have noted your adventure, as you home-bred youths may perhaps
      term it, concerning the visit of your doughty laird. We travellers hold
      such an incident no great consequence, though it may serve to embellish
      the uniform life of Brown&rsquo;s Square. But art thou not ashamed to attempt to
      interest one who is seeing the world at large, and studying human nature
      on a large scale, by so bald a narrative? Why, what does it amount to,
      after all, but that a Tory laird dined with a Whig lawyer? no very
      uncommon matter, especially as you state Mr. Herries to have lost the
      estate, though retaining the designation. The laird behaves with
      haughtiness and impertinence&mdash;nothing out of character in that: is
      NOT kicked down stairs, as he ought to have been, were Alan Fairford half
      the man that he would wish his friends to think him. Aye, but then, as the
      young lawyer, instead of showing his friend the door, chose to make use of
      it himself, he overheard the laird aforesaid ask the old lawyer concerning
      Darsie Latimer&mdash;no doubt earnestly inquiring after the handsome,
      accomplished inmate of his family, who has so lately made Themis his bow
      and declined the honour of following her farther. You laugh at me for my
      air-drawn castles; but confess, have they not surer footing, in general,
      than two words spoken by such a man as Herries? And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;I
      would rally the matter off, Alan; but in dark nights even the glow-worm
      becomes an object of lustre, and to one plunged in my uncertainty and
      ignorance, the slightest gleam that promises intelligence is interesting.
      My life is like the subterranean river in the Peak of Derby, visible only
      where it crosses the celebrated cavern. I am here, and this much I know;
      but where I have sprung from, or whither my course of life is like to
      tend, who shall tell me? Your father, too, seemed interested and alarmed,
      and talked of writing; would to Heaven he may!&mdash;I send daily to the
      post-town for letters.

      LETTER VIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      ALAN FAIRFORD TO DARSIE LATIMER
    </h3>
    <p>
      Thou mayst clap thy wings and crow as thou pleasest. You go in search of
      adventures, but adventures come to me unsought for; and oh! in what a
      pleasing shape came mine, since it arrived in the form of a client&mdash;and
      a fair client to boot! What think you of that, Darsie! you who are such a
      sworn squire of dames? Will this not match my adventures with thine, that
      hunt salmon on horseback, and will it not, besides, eclipse the history of
      a whole tribe of Broadbrims?&mdash;But I must proceed methodically.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I returned to-day from the College, I was surprised to see a broad
      grin distending the adust countenance of the faithful James Wilkinson,
      which, as the circumstance seldom happens above once a year, was matter of
      some surprise. Moreover, he had a knowing glance with his eye, which I
      should have as soon expected from a dumb-waiter&mdash;an article of
      furniture to which James, in his usual state, may be happily assimilated.
      &lsquo;What the devil is the matter, James?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The devil may be in the matter, for aught I ken,&rsquo; said James, with
      another provoking grin; &lsquo;for here has been a woman calling for you,
      Maister Alan.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A woman calling for me?&rsquo; said I in surprise; for you know well, that
      excepting old Aunt Peggy, who comes to dinner of a Sunday, and the still
      older Lady Bedrooket, who calls ten times a year for the quarterly payment
      of her jointure of four hundred merks, a female scarce approaches our
      threshold, as my father visits all his female clients at their own
      lodgings. James protested, however, that there had been a lady calling,
      and for me. &lsquo;As bonny a lass as I have seen,&rsquo; added James, &lsquo;since I was in
      the Fusileers, and kept company with Peg Baxter.&rsquo; Thou knowest all James&rsquo;s
      gay recollections go back to the period of his military service, the years
      he has spent in ours having probably been dull enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did the lady leave no name nor place of address?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied James; &lsquo;but she asked when you wad be at hame, and I
      appointed her for twelve o&rsquo;clock, when the house wad be quiet, and your
      father at the Bank.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For shame, James! how can you think my father&rsquo;s being at home or abroad
      could be of consequence?&mdash;The lady is of course a decent person?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;se uphaud her that, sir&mdash;she is nane of your&mdash;WHEW&rsquo;&mdash;(Here
      James supplied a blank with a low whistle)&mdash;&lsquo;but I didna ken&mdash;my
      maister makes an unco wark if a woman comes here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I passed into my own room, not ill-pleased that my father was absent,
      notwithstanding I had thought it proper to rebuke James for having so
      contrived it, I disarranged my books, to give them the appearance of a
      graceful confusion on the table, and laying my foils (useless since your
      departure) across the mantelpiece, that the lady might see I was TAM MARTE
      QUAM MERCURIO&mdash;I endeavoured to dispose my dress so as to resemble an
      elegant morning deshabille&mdash;gave my hair the general shade of powder
      which marks the gentleman&mdash;laid my watch and seals on the table, to
      hint that I understood the value of time;&mdash;and when I had made all
      these arrangements, of which I am a little ashamed when I think of them, I
      had nothing better to do than to watch the dial-plate till the index
      pointed to noon. Five minutes elapsed, which. I allowed for variation of
      clocks&mdash;five minutes more rendered me anxious and doubtful&mdash;and
      five minutes more would have made me impatient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laugh as thou wilt; but remember, Darsie, I was a lawyer, expecting his
      first client&mdash;a young man, how strictly bred up I need not remind
      you, expecting a private interview with a young and beautiful woman. But
      ere the third term of five minutes had elapsed, the door-bell was heard to
      tinkle low and modestly, as if touched by some timid hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      James Wilkinson, swift in nothing, is, as thou knowest, peculiarly slow in
      answering the door-bell; and I reckoned on five minutes good, ere his
      solemn step should have ascended the stair. Time enough, thought I, for a
      peep through the blinds, and was hastening to the window accordingly. But
      I reckoned without my host; for James, who had his own curiosity as well
      as I, was lying PERDU in the lobby, ready to open at the first tinkle; and
      there was, &lsquo;This way, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;Yes, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;The lady, Mr. Alan,&rsquo; 
      before I could get to the chair in which I proposed to be discovered,
      seated in all legal dignity. The consciousness of being half-caught in the
      act of peeping, joined to that native air of awkward bashfulness of which
      I am told the law will soon free me, kept me standing on the floor in some
      confusion; while the lady, disconcerted on her part, remained on the
      threshold of the room. James Wilkinson, who had his senses most about him,
      and was perhaps willing to prolong his stay in the apartment, busied
      himself in setting a chair for the lady, and recalled me to my
      good-breeding by the hint. I invited her to take possession of it, and bid
      James withdraw.
    </p>
    <p>
      My visitor was undeniably a lady, and probably considerably above the
      ordinary rank&mdash;very modest, too, judging from the mixture of grace
      and timidity with which she moved, and at my entreaty sat down. Her dress
      was, I should suppose, both handsome and fashionable; but it was much
      concealed by a walking-cloak of green silk, fancifully embroidered; in
      which, though heavy for the season, her person was enveloped, and which,
      moreover, was furnished with a hood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The devil take that hood, Darsie! for I was just able to distinguish that,
      pulled as it was over the face, it concealed from me, as I was convinced,
      one of the prettiest countenances I have seen, and which, from a sense of
      embarrassment, seemed to be crimsoned with a deep blush. I could see her
      complexion was beautiful&mdash;her chin finely turned&mdash;her lips coral&mdash;and
      her teeth rivals to ivory. But further the deponent sayeth not; for a
      clasp of gold, ornamented with it sapphire, closed the envious mantle
      under the incognita&rsquo;s throat, and the cursed hood concealed entirely the
      upper part of the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ought to have spoken first, that is certain; but ere I could get my
      phrases well arranged, the young lady, rendered desperate I suppose by my
      hesitation opened the conversation herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fear I am an intruder, sir&mdash;I expected to meet an elderly
      gentleman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This brought me to myself. &lsquo;My father, madam, perhaps. But you inquired
      for Alan Fairford&mdash;my father&rsquo;s name is Alexander.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is Mr. Alan Fairford, undoubtedly, with whom I wished to speak,&rsquo; she
      said, with greater confusion; &lsquo;but I was told that he was advanced in
      life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some mistake, madam, I presume, betwixt my father and myself&mdash;our
      Christian names have the same initials, though the terminations are
      different. I&mdash;I&mdash;I would esteem it a most fortunate mistake if I
      could have the honour of supplying my father&rsquo;s place in anything that
      could be of service to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are very obliging, sir,&rsquo; A pause, during which she seemed
      undetermined whether to rise or sit still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am just about to be called to the bar, madam,&rsquo; said I, in hopes to
      remove her scruples to open her case to me; &lsquo;and if my advice or opinion
      could be of the slightest use, although I cannot presume to say that they
      are much to be depended upon, yet&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady arose. &lsquo;I am truly sensible of your kindness, sir; and I have no
      doubt of your talents. I will be very plain with you&mdash;it is you whom
      I came to visit; although, now that we have met, I find it will be much
      better that I should commit my communication to writing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope, madam, you will not be so cruel&mdash;so tantalizing, I would
      say. Consider, you are my first client&mdash;your business my first
      consultation&mdash;do not do me the displeasure of withdrawing your
      confidence because I am a few years younger than you seem to have
      expected. My attention shall make amends for my want of experience.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no doubt of either,&rsquo; said the lady, in a grave tone, calculated to
      restrain the air of gallantry with which I had endeavoured to address her.
      &lsquo;But when you have received my letter you will find good reasons assigned
      why a written communication will best suit my purpose. I wish you, sir, a
      good morning.&rsquo; And she left the apartment, her poor baffled counsel
      scraping, and bowing, and apologizing for anything that might have been
      disagreeable to her, although the front of my offence seems to be my
      having been discovered to be younger than my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was opened&mdash;out she went&mdash;walked along the pavement,
      turned down the close, and put the sun, I believe, into her pocket when
      she disappeared, so suddenly did dullness and darkness sink down on the
      square, when she was no longer visible. I stood for a moment as if I had
      been senseless, not recollecting what a fund of entertainment I must have
      supplied to our watchful friends on the other side of the green. Then it
      darted on my mind that I might dog her, and ascertain at least who or what
      she was. Off I set&mdash;ran down the close, where she was no longer to be
      seen, and demanded of one of the dyer&rsquo;s lads whether he had seen a lady go
      down the close, or had observed which way she turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A leddy!&rsquo;&mdash;said the dyer, staring at me with his rainbow
      countenance. &lsquo;Mr. Alan, what takes you out, rinning like daft, without
      your hat?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The devil take my hat!&rsquo; answered I, running back, however, in quest of
      it; snatched it up, and again sallied forth. But as I reached the head of
      the close once more, I had sense enough to recollect that all pursuit
      would be now in vain. Besides, I saw my friend, the journeyman dyer, in
      close confabulation with a pea-green personage of his own profession, and
      was conscious, like Scrub, that they talked of me, because they laughed
      consumedly. I had no mind, by a second sudden appearance, to confirm the
      report that Advocate Fairford was &lsquo;gaen daft,&rsquo; which had probably spread
      from Campbell&rsquo;s Close-foot to the Meal-market Stairs; and so slunk back
      within my own hole again.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first employment was to remove all traces of that elegant and fanciful
      disposition of my effects, from which I had hoped for so much credit; for
      I was now ashamed and angry at having thought an instant upon the mode of
      receiving a visit which had commenced so agreeably, but terminated in a
      manner so unsatisfactory. I put my folios in their places&mdash;threw the
      foils into the dressing-closet&mdash;tormenting myself all the while with
      the fruitless doubt, whether I had missed an opportunity or escaped a
      stratagem, or whether the young person had been really startled, as she
      seemed to intimate, by the extreme youth of her intended legal adviser.
      The mirror was not unnaturally called in to aid; and that
      cabinet-counsellor pronounced me rather short, thick-set, with a cast of
      features fitter, I trust, for the bar than the ball&mdash;not handsome
      enough for blushing virgins to pine for my sake, or even to invent sham
      cases to bring them to my chambers&mdash;yet not ugly enough either to
      scare those away who came on real business&mdash;dark, to be sure, but&mdash;NIGRI
      SUNT HYACINTHI&mdash;there are pretty things to be said in favour of that
      complexion.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length&mdash;as common sense will get the better in all cases when a
      man will but give it fair play&mdash;I began to stand convicted in my own
      mind, as an ass before the interview, for having expected too much&mdash;an
      ass during the interview, for having failed to extract the lady&rsquo;s real
      purpose&mdash;and an especial ass, now that it was over, for thinking so
      much about it. But I can think of nothing else, and therefore I am
      determined to think of this to some good purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      You remember Murtough O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s defence of the Catholic doctrine of
      confession; because, &lsquo;by his soul, his sins were always a great burden to
      his mind, till he had told them to the priest; and once confessed, he
      never thought more about them.&rsquo; I have tried his receipt, therefore; and
      having poured my secret mortification into thy trusty ear, I will think no
      more about this maid of the mist,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   Who, with no face, as &lsquo;twere, outfaced me.
</pre>
    <p>
      &mdash;Four o&rsquo;clock. Plague on her green mantle, she can be nothing better
      than a fairy; she keeps possession of my head yet! All during dinner-time
      I was terribly absent; but, luckily, my father gave the whole credit of my
      reverie to the abstract nature of the doctrine, VINCO VINCENTEM, ERGO
      VINCO TE; upon which brocard of law the professor this morning lectured.
      So I got an early dismissal to my own crib, and here am I studying, in one
      sense, VINCERE VINCENTEM, to get the better of the silly passion of
      curiosity&mdash;I think&mdash;I think it amounts to nothing else&mdash;which
      has taken such possession of my imagination, and is perpetually worrying
      me with the question&mdash;will she write or no? She will not&mdash;she
      will not! So says Reason, and adds, Why should she take the trouble to
      enter into correspondence with one who, instead of a bold, alert, prompt
      gallant, proved a chicken-hearted boy, and left her the whole awkwardness
      of explanation, which he should have met half-way? But then, says Fancy,
      she WILL write, for she was not a bit that sort of person whom you, Mr.
      Reason, in your wisdom, take her to be. She was disconcerted enough,
      without my adding to her distress by any impudent conduct on my part. And
      she will write, for&mdash;By Heaven, she HAS written, Darsie, and with a
      vengeance! Here is her letter, thrown into the kitchen by a caddie, too
      faithful to be bribed, either by money or whisky, to say more than that he
      received it, with sixpence, from an ordinary-looking woman, as he was
      plying on his station near the Cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;FOR ALAN FAIRFORD, ESQUIRE, BARRISTER. &lsquo;SIR,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Excuse my mistake of to-day. I had accidentally learnt that Mr. Darsie
      Latimer had an intimate friend and associate in Mr. A. Fairford. When I
      inquired for such a person, he was pointed out to me at the Cross (as I
      think the Exchange of your city is called) in the character of a
      respectable elderly man&mdash;your father, as I now understand. On inquiry
      at Brown&rsquo;s Square, where I understood he resided, I used the full name of
      Alan, which naturally occasioned you the trouble of this day&rsquo;s visit. Upon
      further inquiry, I am led to believe that you are likely to be the person
      most active in the matter to which I am now about to direct your
      attention; and I regret much that circumstances, arising out of my own
      particular situation, prevent my communicating to you personally what I
      now apprise you of in this matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your friend, Mr. Darsie Latimer, is in a situation of considerable
      danger. You are doubtless aware that he has been cautioned not to trust
      himself in England. Now, if he has not absolutely transgressed this
      friendly injunction, he has at least approached as nearly to the menaced
      danger as he could do, consistently with the letter of the prohibition. He
      has chosen his abode in a neighbourhood very perilous to him; and it is
      only by a speedy return to Edinburgh, or at least by a removal to some
      more remote part of Scotland, that he can escape the machinations of those
      whose enmity he has to fear. I must speak in mystery, but my words are not
      the less certain; and, I believe, you know enough of your friend&rsquo;s
      fortunes to be aware that I could not write this much without being even
      more intimate with them than you are.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If he cannot, or will not, take the advice here given, it is my opinion
      that you should join him, if possible, without delay, and use, by your
      personal presence and entreaty, the arguments which may prove ineffectual
      in writing. One word more, and I implore of your candour to take it as it
      is meant. No one supposes that Mr. Fairford&rsquo;s zeal in his friend&rsquo;s service
      needs to be quickened by mercenary motives. &lsquo;But report says, that Mr.
      Alan Fairford, not having yet entered on his professional career, may, in
      such a case as this, want the means, though he cannot want the
      inclination, to act with promptitude. The enclosed note Mr. Alan Fairford
      must be pleased to consider as his first professional emolument; and she
      who sends it hopes it will be the omen of unbounded success, though the
      fee comes from a hand so unknown as that of &lsquo;GREEN MANTLE&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bank-note of L20 was the enclosure, and the whole incident left me
      speechless with astonishment. I am not able to read over the beginning of
      my own letter, which forms the introduction to this extraordinary
      communication. I only know that, though mixed with a quantity of foolery
      (God knows very much different from my present feelings), it gives an
      account sufficiently accurate, of the mysterious person from whom this
      letter comes, and that I have neither time nor patience to separate the
      absurd commentary from the text, which it is so necessary you should know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Combine this warning, so strangely conveyed, with the caution impressed on
      you by your London correspondent, Griffiths, against your visiting England&mdash;with
      the character of your Laird of the Solway Lakes&mdash;with the lawless
      habits of the people on that frontier country, where warrants are not
      easily executed owing to the jealousy entertained by either country of the
      legal interference of the other; remember, that even Sir John Fielding
      said to my father that he could never trace a rogue beyond the Briggend of
      Dumfries&mdash;think that the distinctions of Whig and Tory, Papist and
      Protestant, still keep that country in a loose and comparatively lawless
      state&mdash;think of all this, my dearest Darsie, and remember that, while
      at this Mount Sharon of yours, you are residing with a family actually
      menaced with forcible interference, and who, while their obstinacy
      provokes violence, are by principle bound to abstain from resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nay, let me tell you, professionally, that the legality of the mode of
      fishing practised by your friend Joshua is greatly doubted by our best
      lawyers; and that, if the stake-nets be considered as actually an unlawful
      obstruction raised in the channel of the estuary, an assembly of persons
      who shall proceed, VIA FACTI, to pull dawn and destroy them, would not, in
      the eye of the law, be esteemed guilty of a riot. So, by remaining where
      you are, YOU are likely to be engaged in a quarrel with which you have
      nothing to do, and thus to enable your enemies, whoever these may be, to
      execute, amid the confusion of a general hubbub, whatever designs they may
      have against your personal safety. Black-fishers, poachers, and smugglers
      are a sort of gentry that will not be much checked, either by your
      Quaker&rsquo;s texts, or by your chivalry. If you are Don Quixote enough to lay
      lance in rest, in defence of those of the stake-net, and of the
      sad-coloured garment, I pronounce you but a lost knight; for, as I said
      before, I doubt if these potent redressers of wrongs, the justices and
      constables, will hold themselves warranted to interfere. In a word,
      return, my dear Amadis; the adventure of the Solway-nets is not reserved
      for your worship. Come back, and I will be your faithful Sancho Panza upon
      a more hopeful quest. We will beat about together, in search of this
      Urganda, the Unknown She of the Green Mantle, who can read this, the
      riddle of thy fate, better than wise Eppie of Buckhaven, [Well known in
      the Chap-Book, called the History of Buckhaven.] or Cassandra herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would fain trifle, Darsie; for, in debating with you, jests will
      sometimes go farther than arguments; but I am sick at heart and cannot
      keep the ball up. If you have a moment&rsquo;s regard for the friendship we have
      so often vowed to each other, let my wishes for once prevail over your own
      venturous and romantic temper. I am quite serious in thinking that the
      information communicated to my father by this Mr. Herries, and the
      admonitory letter of the young lady, bear upon each other; and that, were
      you here, you might learn something from one or other, or from both, that;
      might throw light on your birth and parentage. You will not, surely,
      prefer an idle whim to the prospect which is thus held out to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      I would, agreeably to the hint I have received in the young lady&rsquo;s letter
      (for I am confident that such is her condition), have ere now been with
      you to urge these things, instead of pouring them out upon paper. But you
      know that the day for my trials is appointed; I have already gone through
      the form of being introduced to the examinators, and have gotten my titles
      assigned me. All this should not keep me at home, but my father would view
      any irregularity upon this occasion as a mortal blow to the hopes which he
      has cherished most fondly during his life; viz. my being called to the bar
      with some credit. For my own part, I know there is no great difficulty in
      passing these formal examinations, else how have some of our acquaintance
      got through them? But, to my father, these formalities compose an august
      and serious solemnity, to which he has long looked forward, and my
      absenting myself at this moment would wellnigh drive him distracted. Yet I
      shall go altogether distracted myself, if I have not an instant assurance
      from you that you are hastening hither. Meanwhile I have desired Hannah to
      get your little crib into the best order possible. I cannot learn that my
      father has yet written to you; nor has he spoken more of his communication
      with Birrenswork; but when I let him have some inkling of the dangers you
      are at present incurring, I know my request that you will return
      immediately will have his cordial support.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another reason yet&mdash;I must give a dinner, as usual, upon my
      admission, to our friends; and my father, laying aside all his usual
      considerations of economy, has desired it may be in the best style
      possible. Come hither then, dear Darsie! or, I protest to you, I shall
      send examination, admission-dinner, and guests to the devil, and come, in
      person, to fetch you with a vengeance. Thine, in much anxiety, A. F.

      LETTER IX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      ALEXANDER FAIRFORD, W.S., TO MR. DARSIE LATIMER
    </h3>
    <p>
      DEAR MR. DARSIE,
    </p>
    <p>
      Having been your FACTOR LOCO TUTORIS or rather, I ought to say, in
      correctness (since I acted without warrant from the court), your
      NEGOTIORUM GESTOR, that connexion occasions my present writing. And
      although having rendered an account of my intromissions, which have been
      regularly approved of, not only by yourself (whom I could not prevail upon
      to look at more than the docket and sum total), but also by the worthy Mr.
      Samuel Griffiths of London, being the hand through whom the remittances
      were made, I may, in some sense, be considered as to you FUNCTUS OFFICIO;
      yet to speak facetiously, I trust you will not hold me accountable as a
      vicious intromitter, should I still consider myself as occasionally
      interested in your welfare. My motives for writing, at this time, are
      twofold.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have met with a Mr. Herries of Birrenswork, a gentleman of very ancient
      descent, but who hath in time past been in difficulties, nor do I know if
      his affairs are yet well redd. Birrenswork says that he believes he was
      very familiar with your father, whom he states to have been called Ralph
      Latimer of Langcote Hall, in Westmoreland; and he mentioned family
      affairs, which it may be of the highest importance to you to be acquainted
      with; but as he seemed to decline communicating them to me, I could not
      civilly urge him thereanent. Thus much I know, that Mr. Herries had his
      own share in the late desperate and unhappy matter of 1745, and was in
      trouble about it, although that is probably now over. Moreover, although
      he did not profess the Popish religion openly, he had an eye that way. And
      both of these are reasons why I have hesitated to recommend him to a youth
      who maybe hath not altogether so well founded his opinions concerning Kirk
      and State, that they might not be changed by some sudden wind of doctrine.
      For I have observed ye, Master Darsie, to be rather tinctured with the old
      leaven of prelacy&mdash;this under your leave; and although God forbid
      that you should be in any manner disaffected to the Protestant Hanoverian
      line, yet ye have ever loved to hear the blawing, blazing stories which
      the Hieland gentlemen tell of those troublous times, which, if it were
      their will, they had better pretermit, as tending rather to shame than to
      honour. It is come to me also by a sidewind, as I may say, that you have
      been neighbouring more than was needful among some of the pestilent sect
      of Quakers&mdash;a people who own neither priest nor king, nor civil
      magistrate, nor the fabric of our law, and will not depone either IN
      CIVILIBUS or CRIMINALIBUS, be the loss to the lieges what it may. Anent
      which heresies, it were good ye read &lsquo;The Snake in the Grass&rsquo; or &lsquo;The Foot
      out of the Snare,&rsquo; being both well-approved tracts, touching these
      doctrines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Mr. Darsie, ye are to judge for yourself whether ye can safely to
      your soul&rsquo;s weal remain longer among these Papists and Quakers&mdash;these
      defections on the right hand, and failings away on the left; and truly if
      you can confidently resist these evil examples of doctrine, I think ye may
      as well tarry in the bounds where ye are, until you see Mr. Herries of
      Birrenswork, who does assuredly know more of your matters than I thought
      had been communicated to any man in Scotland. I would fain have
      precognosced him myself on these affairs, but found him unwilling to speak
      out, as I have partly intimated before.
    </p>
    <p>
      To call a new cause&mdash;I have the pleasure to tell you, that Alan has
      passed his private Scots Law examinations with good approbation&mdash;a
      great relief to my mind; especially as worthy Mr. Pest told me in my ear
      there was no fear of &lsquo;the callant&rsquo;, as he familiarly called him, which
      gives me great heart. His public trials, which are nothing in comparison
      save a mere form, are to take place, by order of the Honourable Dean of
      Faculty, on Wednesday first; and on Friday he puts on the gown, and gives
      a bit chack of dinner to his friends and acquaintances, as is, you know,
      the custom. Your company will be wished for there, Master Darsie, by more
      than him, which I regret to think is impossible to have, as well by your
      engagements, as that our cousin, Peter Fairford, comes from the West on
      purpose, and we have no place to offer him but your chamber in the wall.
      And, to be plain with you, after my use and wont, Master Darsie, it may be
      as well that Alan and you do not meet till he is hefted as it were to his
      new calling. You are a pleasant gentleman, and full of daffing, which may
      well become you, as you have enough (as I understand) to uphold your merry
      humour. If you regard the matter wisely, you would perchance consider that
      a man of substance should have a douce and staid demeanour; yet you are so
      far from growing grave and considerate with the increase of your annual
      income, that the richer you become, the merrier I think you grow. But this
      must be at your own pleasure, so far as you are concerned. Alan, however
      (overpassing my small savings), has the world to win; and louping and
      laughing, as you and he were wont to do, would soon make the powder flee
      out of his wig, and the pence out of his pocket. Nevertheless, I trust you
      will meet when you return from your rambles; for there is a time, as the
      wise man sayeth, for gathering, and a time for casting away; it is always
      the part of a man of sense to take the gathering time first. I remain,
      dear sir, your well-wishing friend; and obedient to command, ALEXANDER
      FAIRFORD.
    </p>
    <p>
      PS.&mdash;Alan&rsquo;s Thesis is upon the title DE PERICULO ET COMMODO REI
      VENDITAE, and is a very pretty piece of Latinity.&mdash;Ross House, in our
      neighbourhood, is nearly finished, and is thought to excel Duff House in
      ornature.

    <h2>
      LETTER X
    </h2>
    <h3>
      DARSIE LATIMER TO ALAN FAIRFORD
    </h3>
    <p>
      The plot thickens, Alan. I have your letter, and also one from your
      father. The last makes it impossible for me to comply with the kind
      request which the former urges. No&mdash;I cannot be with you, Alan; and
      that, for the best of all reasons&mdash;I cannot and ought not to
      counteract your father&rsquo;s anxious wishes. I do not take it unkind of him
      that he desires my absence. It is natural that he should wish for his son
      what his son so well deserves&mdash;the advantage of a wiser and steadier
      companion than I seem to him. And yet I am sure I have often laboured hard
      enough to acquire that decency of demeanour which can no more be suspected
      of breaking bounds, than an owl of catching a butterfly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was in vain that I have knitted my brows till I had the headache,
      in order to acquire the reputation of a grave, solid, and well-judging
      youth. Your father always has discovered, or thought that he discovered, a
      hare-brained eccentricity lying folded among the wrinkles of my forehead,
      which rendered me a perilous associate for the future counsellor and
      ultimate judge. Well, Corporal Nym&rsquo;s philosophy must be my comfort&mdash;&lsquo;Things
      must be as they may.&rsquo;&mdash;I cannot come to your father&rsquo;s house, where he
      wishes not to see me; and as to your coming hither,&mdash;by all that is
      dear to me, I vow that if you are guilty of such a piece of reckless folly&mdash;not
      to say undutiful cruelty, considering your father&rsquo;s thoughts and wishes&mdash;I
      will never speak to you again as long as I live! I am perfectly serious.
      And besides, your father, while he in a manner prohibits me from returning
      to Edinburgh, gives me the strongest reasons for continuing a little while
      longer in this country, by holding out the hope that I may receive from
      your old friend, Mr. Herries of Birrenswork, some particulars concerning
      my origin, with which that ancient recusant seems to be acquainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      That gentleman mentioned the name of a family in Westmoreland, with which
      he supposes me connected. My inquiries here after such a family have been
      ineffectual, for the borderers, on either side, know little of each other.
      But I shall doubtless find some English person of whom to make inquiries,
      since the confounded fetterlock clapped on my movements by old Griffiths,
      prevents me repairing to England in person. At least, the prospect of
      obtaining some information is greater here than elsewhere; it will be an
      apology for my making a longer stay in this neighbourhood, a line of
      conduct which seems to have your father&rsquo;s sanction, whose opinion must be
      sounder than that of your wandering damoselle.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the road were paved with dangers which leads to such a discovery, I
      cannot for a moment hesitate to tread it. But in fact there is no peril in
      the case. If the Tritons of the Solway shall proceed to pull down honest
      Joshua&rsquo;s tide-nets, I am neither Quixote enough in disposition, nor
      Goliath enough in person, to attempt their protection. I have no idea of
      attempting to prop a falling house by putting my shoulders against it. And
      indeed, Joshua gave me a hint that the company which he belongs to,
      injured in the way threatened (some of them being men who thought after
      the fashion of the world), would pursue the rioters at law, and recover
      damages, in which probably his own ideas of non-resistance will not
      prevent his participating. Therefore the whole affair will take its course
      as law will, as I only mean to interfere when it may be necessary to
      direct the course of the plaintiffs to thy chambers; and I request they
      may find thee intimate with all the Scottish statutes concerning salmon
      fisheries, from the LEX AQUARUM, downward.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the Lady of the Mantle, I will lay a wager that the sun so
      bedazzled thine eyes on that memorable morning, that everything thou didst
      look upon seemed green; and notwithstanding James Wilkinson&rsquo;s experience
      in the Fusileers, as well as his negative whistle, I will venture to hold
      a crown that she is but a what-shall-call-&rsquo;um after all. Let not even the
      gold persuade you to the contrary. She may make a shift to cause you to
      disgorge that, and (immense spoil!) a session&rsquo;s fees to boot, if you look
      not all the sharper about you. Or if it should be otherwise, and if indeed
      there lurk some mystery under this visitation, credit me, it is one which
      thou canst not penetrate, nor can I as yet even attempt to explain it;
      since, if I prove mistaken, and mistaken I may easily be, I would be fain
      to creep into Phalaris&rsquo;s bull, were it standing before me ready heated,
      rather than be roasted with thy raillery. Do not tax me with want of
      confidence; for the instant I can throw any light on the matter thou shalt
      have it; but while I am only blundering about in the dark, I do not choose
      to call wise folks to see me, perchance, break my nose against a post. So
      if you marvel at this,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  E&rsquo;en marvel on till time makes all things plain.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the meantime, kind Alan, let me proceed in my diurnal.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third or fourth day after my arrival at Mount Sharon, Time, that
      bald sexton to whom I have just referred you, did certainly limp more
      heavily along with me than he had done at first. The quaint morality of
      Joshua, and Huguenot simplicity of his sister, began to lose much of their
      raciness with their novelty, and my mode of life, by dint of being very
      quiet, began to feel abominably dull. It was, as thou say&rsquo;st, as if the
      Quakers had put the sun in their pockets&mdash;all around was soft and
      mild, and even pleasant; but there was, in the whole routine, a
      uniformity, a want of interest, a helpless and hopeless languor, which
      rendered life insipid. No doubt, my worthy host and hostess felt none of
      this void, this want of excitation, which was becoming oppressive to their
      guest. They had their little round of occupations, charities, and
      pleasures; Rachel had her poultry-yard and conservatory, and Joshua his
      garden. Besides this, they enjoyed, doubtless, their devotional
      meditations; and, on the whole, time glided softly and imperceptibly on
      with them, though to me, who long for stream and cataract, it seemed
      absolutely to stand still. I meditated returning to Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush, and
      began to think, with some hankering, after little Benjie and the rod. The
      imp has ventured hither, and hovers about to catch a peep of me now and
      then; I suppose the little sharper is angling for a few more sixpences.
      But this would have been, in Joshua&rsquo;s eyes, a return of the washed sow to
      wallowing in the mire, and I resolved, while I remained his guest, to
      spare him so violent a shock to his prejudices. The next point was, to
      shorten the time of my proposed stay; but, alas! that I felt to be equally
      impossible. I had named a week; and however rashly my promise had been
      pledged, it must be held sacred, even according to the letter, from which
      the Friends permit no deviation.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these considerations wrought me up to a kind of impatience yesterday
      evening; so that I snatched up my hat, and prepared for a sally beyond the
      cultivated farm and ornamented grounds of Mount Sharon, just as if I were
      desirous to escape from the realms of art, into those of free and
      unconstrained nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was scarcely more delighted when I first entered this peaceful demesne,
      than I now was&mdash;such is the instability and inconsistency of human
      nature!&mdash;when I escaped from it to the open downs, which had formerly
      seemed so waste and dreary, The air I breathed felt purer and more
      bracing. The clouds, riding high upon a summer breeze, drove, in gay
      succession, over my head, now obscuring the sun, now letting its rays
      stream in transient flashes upon various parts of the landscape, and
      especially upon the broad mirror of the distant Firth of Solway.
    </p>
    <p>
      I advanced on the scene with the light step of a liberated captive; and,
      like John Bunyan&rsquo;s Pilgrim, could have found in my heart to sing as I went
      on my way. It seemed as if my gaiety had accumulated while suppressed, and
      that I was, in my present joyous mood, entitled to expend the savings of
      the previous week. But just as I was about to uplift a merry stave, I
      heard, to my joyful surprise, the voices of three or more choristers,
      singing, with considerable success, the lively old catch,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  For all our men were very very merry,
    And all our men were drinking:
    There were two men of mine,
    Three men of thine,
  And three that belonged to old Sir Thom o&rsquo; Lyne;
  As they went to the ferry, they were very very merry,
    And all our men were drinking.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      [The original of this catch is to be found in Cowley&rsquo;s witty comedy of THE
      GUARDIAN, the first edition. It does not exist in the second and revised
      edition, called THE CUTTER OF COLEMAN STREET.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  CAPTAIN BLADE.  Ha, ha, boys, another catch.
             AND ALL OUR MEN ARE VERY VERY MERRY,
             AND ALL OUR MEN WERE DRINKING.
  CUTTER.    ONE MAN OF MINE.
  DOGREL.    TWO MEN OF MINE.
  BLADE.     THREE MEN OF MINE.
  CUTTER.    AND ONE MAN OF MINE.
  OMNES.     AS WE WENT BY THE WAY WE WERE DRUNK, DRUNK, DAMNABLY
             DRUNK, AND ALL OUR MEN WERE VERY VERY MERRY, &amp;c.
</pre>
    <p>
      Such are the words, which are somewhat altered and amplified in the text.
      The play was acted in presence of Charles II, then Prince of Wales, in
      1641. The catch in the text has been happily set to music.]
    </p>
    <p>
      As the chorus ended, there followed a loud and hearty laugh by way of
      cheers. Attracted by sounds which were so congenial to my present
      feelings, I made towards the spot from which they came,&mdash;cautiously,
      however, for the downs, as had been repeatedly hinted to me, had no good
      name; and the attraction of the music, without rivalling that of the
      sirens in melody, might have been followed by similarly inconvenient
      consequences to an incautious amateur.
    </p>
    <p>
      I crept on, therefore, trusting that the sinuosities of the ground, broken
      as it was into knells and sand-pits, would permit me to obtain a sight of
      the musicians before I should be observed by them. As I advanced, the old
      ditty was again raised. The voices seemed those of a man and two boys;
      they were rough, but kept good time, and were managed with too much skill
      to belong to the ordinary country people.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Jack looked at the sun, and cried, Fire, fire, fire;
  Tom stabled his keffel in Birkendale mire;
  Jem started a calf, and halloo&rsquo;d for a stag;
  Will mounted a gate-post instead of his nag:
  For all our men were very very merry,
    And all our men were drinking;
      There were two men of mine,
      Three men of thine,
  And three that belonged to old Sir Thom o&rsquo; Lyne;
  As they went to the ferry, they were very very merry,
    For all our men were drinking.
</pre>
    <p>
      The voices, as they mixed in their several parts, and ran through them,
      untwisting and again entwining all the links of the merry old catch,
      seemed to have a little touch of the bacchanalian spirit which they
      celebrated, and showed plainly that the musicians were engaged in the same
      joyous revel as the MENYIE of old Sir Thom o&rsquo; Lyne. At length I came
      within sight of them, three in number, where they sat cosily niched into
      what you might call a BUNKER, a little sand-pit, dry and snug, and
      surrounded by its banks, and a screen of whins in full bloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only one of the trio whom I recognized as a personal acquaintance was
      the notorious little Benjie, who, having just finished his stave, was
      cramming a huge luncheon of pie-crust into his mouth with one hand, while
      in the other he held a foaming tankard, his eyes dancing with all the glee
      of a forbidden revel; and his features, which have at all times a
      mischievous archness of expression, confessing the full sweetness of
      stolen waters, and bread eaten in secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no mistaking the profession of the male and female, who were
      partners with Benjie in these merry doings. The man&rsquo;s long loose-bodied
      greatcoat (wrap-rascal as the vulgar term it), the fiddle-case, with its
      straps, which lay beside him, and a small knapsack which might contain his
      few necessaries; a clear grey eye; features which, in contending with many
      a storm, had not lost a wild and, careless expression of glee, animated at
      present, when he was exercising for his own pleasure the arts which he
      usually practised for bread,&mdash;all announced one of those peripatetic
      followers of Orpheus whom the vulgar call a strolling fiddler. Gazing more
      attentively, I easily discovered that though the poor musician&rsquo;s eyes were
      open, their sense was shut, and that the ecstasy with which he turned them
      up to heaven only derived its apparent expression from his own internal
      emotions, but received no assistance from the visible objects around.
      Beside him sat his female companion, in a man&rsquo;s hat, a blue coat, which
      seemed also to have been an article of male apparel, and a red petticoat.
      She was cleaner, in person and in clothes, than such itinerants generally
      are; and, having been in her day a strapping BONA ROBA, she did not even
      yet neglect some attention to her appearance; wore a large amber necklace,
      and silver ear-rings, and had her laid fastened across her breast with a
      brooch of the same metal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man also looked clean, notwithstanding the meanness of his attire, and
      had a decent silk handkerchief well knotted about his throat, under which
      peeped a clean owerlay. His beard, also, instead of displaying a grizzly
      stubble, unmowed for several days, flowed in thick and comely abundance
      over the breast, to the length of six inches, and mingled with his hair,
      which was but beginning to exhibit a touch of age. To sum up his
      appearance, the loose garment which I have described was secured around
      him by a large old-fashioned belt, with brass studs, in which hung a dirk,
      with a knife and fork, its usual accompaniments. Altogether, there was
      something more wild and adventurous-looking about the man than I could
      have expected to see in an ordinary modern crowder; and the bow which he
      now and then drew across the violin, to direct his little choir, was
      decidedly that of no ordinary performer.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must understand that many of these observations were the fruits of
      after remark; for I had scarce approached so near as to get a distinct
      view of the party, when my friend Benjie&rsquo;s lurching attendant, which he
      calls by the appropriate name of Hemp, began to cock his tail and ears,
      and, sensible of my presence, flew, barking like a fury, to the place
      where I had meant to lie concealed till I heard another song. I was
      obliged, however, to jump on my feet, and intimidate Hemp, who would
      otherwise have bit me, by two sound kicks on the ribs, which sent him
      howling back to his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Benjie seemed somewhat dismayed at my appearance; but, calculating
      on my placability, and remembering, perhaps, that the ill-used Solomon was
      no palfrey of mine, he speedily affected great glee, and almost in one
      breath assured the itinerants that I was &lsquo;a grand gentleman, and had
      plenty of money, and was very kind to poor folk;&rsquo; and informed me that
      this was &lsquo;Willie Steenson&mdash;Wandering Willie the best fiddler that
      ever kittled thairm with horse-hair.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman rose and curtsied; and Wandering Willie sanctioned his own
      praises with a nod, and the ejaculation, &lsquo;All is true that the little boy
      says.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked him if he was of this country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;THIS country!&rsquo; replied the blind man&mdash;&lsquo;I am of every country in
      broad Scotland, and a wee bit of England to the boot. But yet I am, in
      some sense, of this country; for I was born within hearing of the roar of
      Solway. Will I give your honour a touch of the auld bread-winner?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He preluded as he spoke, in a manner which really excited my curiosity;
      and then, taking the old tune of Galashiels for his theme, he graced it
      with a number of wild, complicated, and beautiful variations; during which
      it was wonderful to observe how his sightless face was lighted up under
      the conscious pride and heartfelt delight in the exercise of his own very
      considerable powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What think you of that, now, for threescore and twa?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I expressed my surprise and pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A rant, man&mdash;an auld rant,&rsquo; said Willie; &lsquo;naething like the music ye
      hae in your ballhouses and your playhouses in Edinbro&rsquo;; but it&rsquo;s weel
      aneugh anes in a way at a dykeside. Here&rsquo;s another&mdash;it&rsquo;s no a Scotch
      tune, but it passes for ane&mdash;Oswald made it himsell, I reckon&mdash;he
      has cheated mony ane, but he canna cheat Wandering Willie.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He then played your favourite air of Roslin Castle, with a number of
      beautiful variations, some of which I am certain were almost extempore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have another fiddle there, my friend,&rsquo; said I&mdash;&lsquo;Have you a
      comrade?&rsquo; But Willie&rsquo;s ears were deaf, or his attention was still busied
      with the tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      The female replied in his stead, &lsquo;O aye, sir&mdash;troth we have a partner&mdash;a
      gangrel body like oursells. No but my hinny might have been better if he
      had liked; for mony a bein nook in mony a braw house has been offered to
      my hinny Willie, if he wad but just bide still and play to the gentles.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whisht, woman! whisht!&rsquo; said the blind man, angrily, shaking his locks;
      &lsquo;dinna deave the gentleman wi&rsquo; your havers. Stay in a house and play to
      the gentles!&mdash;strike up when my leddy pleases, and lay down the bow
      when my lord bids! Na, na, that&rsquo;s nae life for Willie. Look out, Maggie&mdash;peer
      out, woman, and see if ye can see Robin coming. Deil be in him! He has got
      to the lee-side of some smuggler&rsquo;s punch-bowl, and he wunna budge the
      night, I doubt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is your consort&rsquo;s instrument,&rsquo; said I&mdash;&rsquo; Will you give me leave
      to try my skill?&rsquo; I slipped at the same time a shilling into the woman&rsquo;s
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dinna ken whether I dare trust Robin&rsquo;s fiddle to ye,&rsquo; said Willie,
      bluntly. His wife gave him a twitch. &lsquo;Hout awa, Maggie,&rsquo; he said in
      contempt of the hint; &lsquo;though the gentleman may hae gien ye siller, he may
      have nae bowhand for a&rsquo; that, and I&rsquo;ll no trust Robin&rsquo;s fiddle wi&rsquo; an
      ignoramus. But that&rsquo;s no sae muckle amiss,&rsquo; he added, as I began to touch
      the instrument; &lsquo;I am thinking ye have some skill o&rsquo; the craft.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To confirm him in this favourable opinion, I began to execute such a
      complicated flourish as I thought must have turned Crowdero into a pillar
      of stone with envy and wonder. I scaled the top of the finger-board, to
      dive at once to the bottom&mdash;skipped with flying fingers, like
      Timotheus, from shift to shift&mdash;struck arpeggios and harmonic tones,
      but without exciting any of the astonishment which I had expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Willie indeed listened to me with considerable attention; but I was no
      sooner finished, than he immediately mimicked on his own instrument the
      fantastic complication of tones which I had produced, and made so
      whimsical a parody of my performance, that, although somewhat angry, I
      could not help laughing heartily, in which I was joined by Benjie, whose
      reverence for me held him under no restraint; while the poor dame,
      fearful, doubtless, of my taking offence at this familiarity, seemed
      divided betwixt her conjugal reverence for her Willie, and her desire to
      give him a hint for his guidance.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the old man stopped of his own accord, and, as if he had
      sufficiently rebuked me by his mimicry, he said, &lsquo;But for a&rsquo; that, ye will
      play very weel wi&rsquo; a little practice and some gude teaching. But ye maun
      learn to put the heart into it, man&mdash;to put the heart into it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I played an air in simpler taste, and received more decided approbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s something like it man. Od, ye are a clever birkie!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman touched his coat again. &lsquo;The gentleman is a gentleman, Willie&mdash;ye
      maunna speak that gate to him, hinnie.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The deevil I maunna!&rsquo; said Willie; &lsquo;and what for maunna I?&mdash;If he
      was ten gentles, he canna draw a bow like me, can he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed I cannot, my honest friend,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;and if you will go with me
      to a house hard by, I would be glad to have a night with you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here I looked round, and observed Benjie smothering a laugh, which I was
      sure had mischief in it. I seized him suddenly by the ear, and made him
      confess that he was laughing at the thoughts of the reception which a
      fiddler was likely to get from the Quakers at Mount Sharon. I chucked him
      from me, not sorry that his mirth had reminded me in time of what I had
      for the moment forgotten; and invited the itinerant to go with me to
      Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush, from which I proposed to send word to Mr. Geddes that I
      should not return home that evening. But the minstrel declined this
      invitation also. He was engaged for the night, he said, to a dance in the
      neighbourhood, and vented a round execration on the laziness or
      drunkenness of his comrade, who had not appeared at the place of
      rendezvous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will go with you instead of him,&rsquo; said I, in a sudden whim; &lsquo;and I will
      give you a crown to introduce me as your comrade.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;YOU gang instead of Rob the Rambler! My certie, freend, ye are no blate!&rsquo; 
      answered Wandering Willie, in a tone which announced death to my frolic.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Maggie, whom the offer of the crown had not escaped, began to open on
      that scent with a maundering sort of lecture. &lsquo;Oh Willie! hinny Willie,
      whan will ye learn to be wise? There&rsquo;s a crown to be win for naething but
      saying ae man&rsquo;s name instead of anither. And, wae&rsquo;s me! I hae just a
      shilling of this gentleman&rsquo;s gieing, and a boddle of my ain; and ye wunna,
      bend your will sae muckle as to take up the siller that&rsquo;s flung at your
      feet! Ye will die the death of a cadger&rsquo;s powney, in a wreath of drift!
      and what can I do better than lie doun and die wi&rsquo; you? for ye winna let
      me win siller to keep either you or mysell leevin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Haud your nonsense tongue, woman,&rsquo; said Willie, but less absolutely than
      before. &lsquo;Is he a real gentleman, or ane of the player-men?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;se uphaud him a real gentleman,&rsquo; said the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;se uphaud ye ken little of the matter,&rsquo; said Willie; &lsquo;let us see haud
      of your hand, neebor, gin ye like.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave him my hand. He said to himself, &lsquo;Aye, aye, here are fingers that
      have seen canny service.&rsquo; Then running his hand over my hair, my face, and
      my dress, he went on with his soliloquy; &lsquo;Aye, aye, muisted hair,
      braidclaith o&rsquo; the best, and seenteen hundred linen on his back, at the
      least o&rsquo; it. And how do you think, my braw birkie, that you are to pass
      for a tramping fiddler?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dress is plain,&rsquo; said I,&mdash;indeed I had chosen my most ordinary
      suit, out of compliment to my Quaker friends,&mdash;&lsquo;and I can easily pass
      for a young farmer out upon a frolic. Come, I will double the crown I
      promised you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Damn your crowns!&rsquo; said the disinterested man of music. &lsquo;I would like to
      have a round wi&rsquo; you, that&rsquo;s certain;&mdash;but a farmer, and with a hand
      that never held pleugh-stilt or pettle, that will never do. Ye may pass
      for a trades-lad from Dumfries, or a student upon the ramble, or the like
      o&rsquo; that. But hark ye, lad; if ye expect to be ranting among the queans o&rsquo; 
      lasses where ye are gaun, ye will come by the waur, I can tell ye; for the
      fishers are wild chaps, and will bide nae taunts.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I promised to be civil and cautious; and, to smooth the good woman, I
      slipped the promised piece into her hand. The acute organs of the blind
      man detected this little manoeuvre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are ye at it again wi&rsquo; the siller, ye jaud? I&rsquo;ll be sworn ye wad rather
      hear ae twalpenny clink against another, than have a spring from Rory
      Dall, [Blind Rorie, a famous musician according to tradition.] if he
      was-coming alive again anes errand. Gang doun the gate to Lucky Gregson&rsquo;s
      and get the things ye want, and bide there till ele&rsquo;en hours in the morn;
      and if you see Robin, send him on to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Am I no gaun to the ploy, then?&rsquo; said Maggie, in a disappointed tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what for should ye?&rsquo; said her lord and master; &lsquo;to dance a&rsquo; night,
      I&rsquo;se warrant, and no to be fit to walk your tae&rsquo;s-length the morn, and we
      have ten Scots miles afore us? Na, na. Stable the steed, and pit your wife
      to bed, when there&rsquo;s night wark to do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aweel, aweel, Willie hinnie, ye ken best; but oh, take an unco care o&rsquo; 
      yoursell, and mind ye haena the blessing o&rsquo; sight.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your tongue gars me whiles tire of the blessing of hearing, woman,&rsquo; 
      replied &lsquo;Willie, in answer to this tender exhortation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I now put in for my interest. &lsquo;Hollo, good folks, remember that I am
      to send the boy to Mount Sharon, and if you go to the Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush,
      honest woman, how the deuce am I to guide the blind man where he is going?
      I know little or nothing of the country.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And ye ken mickle less of my hinnie, sir,&rsquo; replied Maggie, &lsquo;that think he
      needs ony guiding; he&rsquo;s the best guide himsell that ye&rsquo;ll find between
      Criffell and Carlisle. Horse-road and foot-path, parish-road and
      kirk-road, high-road and cross-road, he kens ilka foot of ground in
      Nithsdale.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, ye might have said in braid Scotland, gudewife,&rsquo; added the fiddler.
      &lsquo;But gang your ways, Maggie, that&rsquo;s the first wise word ye hae spoke the
      day. I wish it was dark night, and rain, and wind, for the gentleman&rsquo;s
      sake, that I might show him there is whiles when ane had better want een
      than have them; for I am as true a guide by darkness as by daylight.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Internally as well pleased that my companion was not put to give me this
      last proof of his skill, I wrote a note with a pencil, desiring Samuel to
      bring my horses at midnight, when I thought my frolic would be wellnigh
      over, to the place to which the bearer should direct him, and I sent
      little Benjie with an apology to the worthy Quakers.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we parted in different directions, the good woman said, &lsquo;Oh, sir, if ye
      wad but ask Willie to tell ye ane of his tales to shorten the gate! He can
      speak like ony minister frae the pu&rsquo;pit, and he might have been a minister
      himsell, but&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Haud your tongue, ye fule!&rsquo; said Willie,&mdash;&lsquo;But stay, Meg&mdash;gie
      me a kiss, ne maunna part in anger, neither.&rsquo;&mdash;And thus our society
      separated.

    <h2>
      LETTER XI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE SAME TO THE SAME
    </h3>
    <p>
      You are now to conceive us proceeding in our different directions across
      the bare downs. Yonder flies little Benjie to the northward with Hemp
      scampering at his heels, both running as if for dear life so long as the
      rogue is within sight of his employer, and certain to take the walk very
      easy so soon as he is out of ken. Stepping westward, you see Maggie&rsquo;s tall
      form and high-crowned hat, relieved by the fluttering of her plaid upon
      the left shoulder, darkening as the distance diminishes her size and as
      the level sunbeams begin to sink upon the sea. She is taking her quiet
      journey to the Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, stoutly striding over the lea, you have a full view of Darsie
      Latimer, with his new acquaintance, Wandering Willie, who, bating that he
      touched the ground now and then with his staff, not in a doubtful groping
      manner, but with the confident air of an experienced pilot, heaving the
      lead when he has the soundings by heart, walks as firmly and boldly as if
      he possessed the eyes of Argus. There they go, each with his violin slung
      at his back, but one of them at least totally ignorant whither their
      course is directed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And wherefore did you enter so keenly into such a mad frolic? says my wise
      counsellor.&mdash;Why, I think, upon the whole, that as a sense of
      loneliness, and a longing for that kindness which is interchanged in
      society, led me to take up my temporary residence at Mount Sharon, the
      monotony of my life there, the quiet simplicity of the conversation of the
      Geddeses, and the uniformity of their amusements and employments, wearied
      out my impatient temper, and prepared me for the first escapade which
      chance might throw in my way.
    </p>
    <p>
      What would I have given that I could have procured that solemn grave
      visage of thine, to dignify this joke, as it has done full many a one of
      thine own! Thou hast so happy a knack of doing the most foolish things in
      the wisest manner, that thou mightst pass thy extravagances for rational
      actions, even in the eyes of Prudence herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the direction which my guide observed, I began to suspect that the
      dell at Brokenburn was our probable destination; and it became important
      to me to consider whether I could, with propriety, or even perfect safety,
      intrude myself again upon the hospitality of my former host. I therefore
      asked Willie whether we were bound for the laird&rsquo;s, as folk called him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do ye ken the laird?&rsquo; said Willie, interrupting a sonata of Corelli, of
      which he had whistled several bars with great precision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know the laird a little,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;and therefore I was doubting whether
      I ought to go to his town in disguise.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should doubt, not a little only, but a great deal, before I took ye
      there, my chap,&rsquo; said Wandering Willie; &lsquo;for I am thinking it wad be worth
      little less than broken banes baith to you and me. Na, na, chap, we are no
      ganging to the laird&rsquo;s, but to a blithe birling at the Brokenburn-foot,
      where there will be mony a braw lad and lass; and maybe there may be some
      of the laird&rsquo;s folks, for he never comes to sic splores himsell. He is all
      for fowling-piece and salmon-spear, now that pike and musket are out of
      the question.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has been at soldier, then?&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;se warrant him a soger,&rsquo; answered Willie; &lsquo;but take my advice, and
      speer as little about him as he does about you. Best to let sleeping dogs
      lie. Better say naething about the laird, my man, and tell me instead,
      what sort of a chap ye are that are sae ready to cleik in with an auld
      gaberlunzie fiddler? Maggie says ye&rsquo;re gentle, but a shilling maks a&rsquo; the
      difference that Maggie kens between a gentle and a semple, and your crowns
      wad mak ye a prince of the blood in her een. But I am ane that ken full
      weel that ye may wear good claithes, and have a saft hand, and yet that
      may come of idleness as weel as gentrice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him my name, with the same addition I had formerly given to Mr.
      Joshua Geddes; that I was a law-student, tired of my studies, and rambling
      about for exercise and amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And are ye in the wont of drawing up wi&rsquo; a&rsquo; the gangrel bodies that ye
      meet on the high-road, or find cowering in a sand-bunker upon the links?&rsquo; 
      demanded Willie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no; only with honest folks like yourself, Willie,&rsquo; was my reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Honest folks like me! How do ye ken whether I am honest, or what I am? I
      may be the deevil himsell for what ye ken; for he has power to come
      disguised like an angel of light; and besides he is a prime fiddler. He
      played a sonata to Corelli, ye ken.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something odd in this speech, and the tone in which it was said.
      It seemed as if my companion was not always in his constant mind, or that
      he was willing to try if he could frighten me. I laughed at the
      extravagance of his language, however, and asked him in reply, if he was
      fool enough to believe that the foul fiend would play so silly a
      masquerade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ye ken little about it&mdash;little about it,&rsquo; said the old man, shaking
      his head and beard, and knitting his brows, &lsquo;I could tell ye something
      about that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      What his wife mentioned of his being a tale-teller, as well as a musician,
      now occurred to me; and as you know I like tales of superstition, I begged
      to have a specimen of his talent as we went along.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is very true,&rsquo; said the blind man, &lsquo;that when I am tired of scraping
      thairm or singing ballants, I whiles mak a tale serve the turn among the
      country bodies; and I have some fearsome anes, that make the auld carlines
      shake on the settle, and the bits o&rsquo; bairns skirl on their minnies out
      frae their beds. But this that I am gaun to tell you was a thing that
      befell in our ain house in my father&rsquo;s time&mdash;that is, my father was
      then a hafflins callant; and I tell it to you that it may be a lesson to
      you, that are but a young, thoughtless chap, wha ye draw up wi&rsquo; on a
      lonely road; for muckle was the dool and care that came o&rsquo;t to my
      gudesire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He commenced his tale accordingly, in a distinct narrative tone of voice
      which he raised and depressed with considerable skill; at times sinking
      almost into a whisper, and turning his clear but sightless eyeballs upon
      my face, as if it had been possible for him to witness the impression
      which his narrative made upon my features. I will not spare you a syllable
      of it, although it be of the longest; so I make a dash&mdash;and begin
    </p>
    <p>
      WANDERING WILLIE&rsquo;S TALE.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ye maun have heard of Sir Robert Redgauntlet of that Ilk, who lived in
      these parts before the dear years. The country will lang mind him; and our
      fathers used to draw breath thick if ever they heard him named. He was out
      wi&rsquo; the Hielandmen in Montrose&rsquo;s time; and again he was in the hills wi&rsquo; 
      Glencairn in the saxteen hundred and fifty-twa; and sae when King Charles
      the Second came in, wha was in sic favour as the Laird of Redgauntlet? He
      was knighted at Lonon court, wi&rsquo; the king&rsquo;s ain sword; and being a redhot
      prelatist, he came down here, rampauging like a lion, with commissions of
      lieutenancy (and of lunacy, for what I ken) to put down a&rsquo; the Whigs and
      Covenanters in the country. Wild wark they made of it; for the Whigs were
      as dour as the Cavaliers were fierce, and it was which should first tire
      the other. Redgauntlet was ay for the strong hand; and his name is kend as
      wide in the country as Claverhouse&rsquo;s or Tam Dalyell&rsquo;s. Glen, nor dargle,
      nor mountain, nor cave, could hide the puir hill-folk when Redgauntlet was
      out with bugle and bloodhound after them, as if they had been sae mony
      deer. And troth when they fand them, they didna mak muckle mair ceremony
      than a Hielandman wi&rsquo; a roebuck&mdash;it was just, &lsquo;Will ye tak the test?&rsquo;&mdash;if
      not, &lsquo;Make ready&mdash;present&mdash;fire!&rsquo;&mdash;and there lay the
      recusant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far and wide was Sir Robert hated and feared. Men thought he had a direct
      compact with Satan&mdash;that he was proof against steel&mdash;and that
      bullets happed aff his buff-coat like hailstanes from a hearth&mdash;that
      he had a mear that would turn a hare on the side of Carrifra-gawns [A
      precipitous side of a mountain in Moffatdale.]&mdash;and muckle to the
      same purpose, of whilk mair anon. The best blessing they wared on him was,
      &lsquo;Deil scowp wi&rsquo; Redgauntlet!&rsquo; He wasna a bad master to his ain folk,
      though, and was weel aneugh liked by his tenants; and as for the lackies
      and troopers that raid out wi&rsquo; him to the persecutions, as the Whigs caa&rsquo;d
      those killing times, they wad hae drunken themsells blind to his health at
      ony time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you are to ken that my gudesire lived on Redgauntlet&rsquo;s grund&mdash;they
      ca&rsquo; the place Primrose Knowe. We had lived on the grund, and under the
      Redgauntlets, since the riding days, and lang before. It was a pleasant
      bit; and I think the air is callerer and fresher there than onywhere else
      in the country. It&rsquo;s a&rsquo; deserted now; and I sat on the broken door-cheek
      three days since, and was glad I couldna see the plight the place was in;
      but that&rsquo;s a&rsquo; wide o&rsquo; the mark. There dwelt my gudesire, Steenie Steenson,
      a rambling, rattling chiel&rsquo; he had been in his young days, and could play
      weel on the pipes; he was famous at &lsquo;Hoopers and Girders&rsquo;&mdash;a&rsquo; 
      Cumberland couldna, touch him at &lsquo;Jockie Lattin&rsquo;&mdash;and he had the
      finest finger for the back-lilt between Berwick and Carlisle. The like o&rsquo; 
      Steenie wasna the sort that they made Whigs o&rsquo;. And so he became a Tory,
      as they ca&rsquo; it, which we now ca&rsquo; Jacobites, just out of a kind of
      needcessity, that he might belang to some side or other. He had nae ill
      will to the Whig bodies, and liked little to see the blude rin, though,
      being obliged to follow Sir Robert in hunting and hoisting, watching and
      warding, he saw muckle mischief, and maybe did some, that he couldna
      avoid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Steenie was a kind of favourite with his master, and kend a&rsquo; the folks
      about the castle, and was often sent for to play the pipes when they were
      at their merriment. Auld Dougal MacCallum, the butler, that had followed
      Sir Robert through gude and ill, thick and thin, pool and stream, was
      specially fond of the pipes, and ay gae my gudesire his gude word wi&rsquo; the
      laird; for Dougal could turn his master round his finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weel, round came the Revolution, and it had like to have broken the hearts
      baith of Dougal and his master. But the change was not a&rsquo;thegether sae
      great as they feared, and other folk thought for. The Whigs made an unco
      crawing what they wad do with their auld enemies, and in special wi&rsquo; Sir
      Robert Redgauntlet. But there were ower mony great folks dipped in the
      same doings, to mak a spick and span new warld. So Parliament passed it a&rsquo; 
      ower easy; and Sir Robert, bating that he was held to hunting foxes
      instead of Covenanters, remained just the man he was. [The caution and
      moderation of King William III, and his principles of unlimited
      toleration, deprived the Cameronians of the opportunity they ardently
      desired, to retaliate the injuries which they had received during the
      reign of prelacy, and purify the land, as they called it, from the
      pollution of blood. They esteemed the Revolution, therefore, only a half
      measure, which neither comprehended the rebuilding the Kirk in its full
      splendour, nor the revenge of the death of the Saints on their
      persecutors.] His revel was as loud, and his hall as weel lighted, as ever
      it had been, though maybe he lacked the fines of the nonconformists, that
      used to come to stock his larder and cellar; for it is certain he began to
      be keener about the rents than his tenants used to find him before, and
      they behoved to be prompt to the rent-day, or else the laird wasna
      pleased. And he was sic an awsome body, that naebody cared to anger him;
      for the oaths he swore, and the rage that he used to get into, and the
      looks that he put on, made men sometimes think him a devil incarnate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weel, my gudesire was nae manager&mdash;no that he was a very great
      misguider&mdash;but he hadna the saving gift, and he got twa terms&rsquo; rent
      in arrear. He got the first brash at Whitsunday put ower wi&rsquo; fair word and
      piping; but when Martinmas came, there was a summons from the
      grund-officer to come wi&rsquo; the rent on a day preceese, or else Steenie
      behoved to flit. Sair wark he had to get the siller; but he was
      weel-freended, and at last he got the haill scraped thegether&mdash;a
      thousand merks&mdash;the maist of it was from a neighbour they ca&rsquo;d Laurie
      Lapraik&mdash;a sly tod. Laurie had walth o&rsquo; gear&mdash;could hunt wi&rsquo; the
      hound and rin wi&rsquo; the hare&mdash;and be Whig or Tory, saunt or sinner, as
      the wind stood. He was a professor in this Revolution warld, but he liked
      an orra sough of this warld, and a tune on the pipes weel aneugh at a
      bytime; and abune a&rsquo;, he thought he had gude security for the siller he
      lent my gudesire ower the stocking at Primrose Knowe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away trots my gudesire to Redgauntlet Castle wi&rsquo; a heavy purse and a light
      heart, glad to be out of the laird&rsquo;s danger. Weel, the first thing he
      learned at the castle was, that Sir Robert had fretted himsell into a fit
      of the gout, because he did not appear before twelve&rsquo; o&rsquo;clock. It wasna
      a&rsquo;thegether for sake of the money, Dougal thought; but because he didna
      like to part wi&rsquo; my gudesire aff the grund. Dougal was glad to see
      Steenie, and brought him into the great oak parlour, and there sat the
      laird his leesome lane, excepting that he had beside him a great,
      ill-favoured jackanape, that was a special pet of his; a cankered beast it
      was, and mony an ill-natured trick it played&mdash;ill to please it was,
      and easily angered&mdash;ran about the haill castle, chattering and
      yowling, and pinching, and biting folk, specially before ill weather, or
      disturbances in the state. Sir Robert caa&rsquo;d it Major Weir, after the
      warlock that was burnt; [A celebrated wizard, executed at Edinburgh for
      sorcery and other crimes.] and few folk liked either the name or the
      conditions of the creature&mdash;they thought there was something in it by
      ordinar&mdash;and my gudesire was not just easy in mind when the door shut
      on him, and he saw himself in the room wi&rsquo; naebody but the laird, Dougal
      MacCallum, and the major, a thing that hadna chanced to him before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Robert sat, or, I should say, lay, in a great armed chair, wi&rsquo; his
      grand velvet gown, and his feet on a cradle; for he had baith gout and
      gravel, and his face looked as gash and ghastly as Satan&rsquo;s. Major Weir sat
      opposite to him, in a red laced coat, and the laird&rsquo;s wig on his head; and
      ay as Sir Robert girned wi&rsquo; pain, the jackanape girned too, like a
      sheep&rsquo;s-head between a pair of tangs&mdash;an ill-faur&rsquo;d, fearsome couple
      they were. The laird&rsquo;s buff-coat was hung on a pin behind him, and his
      broadsword and his pistols within reach; for he keepit up the auld fashion
      of having the weapons ready, and a horse saddled day and night, just as he
      used to do when he was able to loup on horseback, and away after ony of
      the hill-folk he could get speerings of. Some said it was for fear of the
      Whigs taking vengeance, but I judge it was just his auld custom&mdash;he
      wasna, gien to fear onything. The rental-book, wi&rsquo; its black cover and
      brass clasps, was lying beside him; and a book of sculduddry sangs was put
      betwixt the leaves, to keep it open at the place where it bore evidence
      against the Goodman of Primrose Knowe, as behind the hand with his mails
      and duties. Sir Robert gave my gudesire a look, as if he would have
      withered his heart in his bosom. Ye maun ken he had a way of bending his
      brows, that men saw the visible mark of a horseshoe in his forehead, deep
      dinted, as if it had been stamped there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are ye come light-handed, ye son of a toom whistle?&rsquo; said Sir Robert.
      &lsquo;Zounds! if you are&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      My gudesire, with as gude acountenance as he could put on, made a leg, and
      placed the bag of money on the table wi&rsquo; a dash, like a man that does
      something clever. The laird drew it to him hastily&mdash;&lsquo;Is it all here,
      Steenie, man?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your honour will find it right,&rsquo; said my gudesire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here, Dougal,&rsquo; said the laird, &lsquo;gie Steenie a tass of brandy downstairs,
      till I count the siller and write the receipt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But they werena weel out of the room, when Sir Robert gied a yelloch that
      garr&rsquo;d the castle rock. Back ran Dougal&mdash;in flew the livery-men&mdash;yell
      on yell gied the laird, ilk ane mair awfu&rsquo; than the ither. My gudesire
      knew not whether to stand or flee, but he ventured back into the parlour,
      where a&rsquo; was gaun hirdy-girdie&mdash;naebody to say &lsquo;come in,&rsquo; or &lsquo;gae
      out.&rsquo; Terribly the laird roared for cauld water to his feet, and wine to
      cool his throat; and Hell, hell, hell, and its flames, was ay the word in
      his mouth. They brought him water, and when they plunged his swollen feet
      into the tub, he cried out it was burning; and folk say that it DID bubble
      and sparkle like a seething cauldron. He flung the cup at Dougal&rsquo;s head,
      and said he had given him blood instead of burgundy; and, sure aneugh, the
      lass washed clotted blood aff the carpet; the neist day. The jackanape
      they caa&rsquo;d Major Weir, it jibbered and cried as if it was mocking its
      master; my gudesire&rsquo;s head was like to turn&mdash;he forgot baith siller
      and receipt, and downstairs he banged; but as he ran, the shrieks came
      faint and fainter; there was a deep-drawn shivering groan, and word gaed
      through the castle that the laird was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weel, away came my gudesire, wi&rsquo; his finger in his mouth, and his best
      hope was that Dougal had seen the money-bag, and heard the laird speak of
      writing the receipt. The young laird, now Sir John, came from Edinburgh,
      to see things put to rights. Sir John and his father never gree&rsquo;d weel.
      Sir John had been bred an advocate, and afterwards sat in the last Scots
      Parliament and voted for the Union, having gotten, it was thought, a rug
      of the compensations&mdash;if his father could have come out of his grave,
      he would have brained him for it on his awn hearthstane. Some thought it
      was easier counting with the auld rough knight than the fair-spoken young
      ane&mdash;but mair of that anon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dougal MacCallum, poor body, neither grat nor grained, but gaed about the
      house looking like a corpse, but directing, as was his duty, a&rsquo; the order
      of the grand funeral. Now Dougal looked ay waur and waur when night was
      coming, and was ay the last to gang to his bed, whilk was in a little
      round just opposite the chamber of dais, whilk his master occupied while
      he was living, and where he now lay in state, as they caa&rsquo;d it,
      weel-a-day! The night before the funeral, Dougal could keep his awn
      counsel nae langer; he came doun with his proud spirit, and fairly asked
      auld Hutcheon to sit in his room with him for an hour. When they were in
      the round, Dougal took ae tass of brandy to himsell, and gave another to
      Hutcheon, and wished him all health and lang life, and said that, for
      himsell, he wasna lang for this world; for that, every night since Sir
      Robert&rsquo;s death, his silver call had sounded from the state chamber, just
      as it used to do at nights in his lifetime, to call Dougal to help to turn
      him in his bed. Dougal said that being alone with the dead on that floor
      of the tower (for naebody cared to wake Sir Robert Redgauntlet like
      another corpse) he had never daured to answer the call, but that now his
      conscience checked him for neglecting his duty; for, &lsquo;though death breaks
      service,&rsquo; said MacCallum, &lsquo;it shall never break my service to Sir Robert;
      and I will answer his next whistle, so be you will stand by me, Hutcheon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hutcheon had nae will to the wark, but he had stood by Dougal in battle
      and broil, and he wad not fail him at this pinch; so down the carles sat
      ower a stoup of brandy, and Hutcheon, who was something of a clerk, would
      have read a chapter of the Bible; but Dougal would hear naething but a
      blaud of Davie Lindsay, whilk was the waur preparation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When midnight came, and the house was quiet as the grave, sure enough the
      silver whistle sounded as sharp and shrill as if Sir Robert was blowing
      it, and up got the twa auld serving-men, and tottered into the room where
      the dead man lay. Hutcheon saw aneugh at the first glance; for there were
      torches in the room, which showed him the foul fiend, in his ain shape,
      sitting on the laird&rsquo;s coffin! Ower he cowped as if he had been dead. He
      could not tell how lang he lay in a trance at the door, but when he
      gathered himself, he cried on his neighbour, and getting nae answer,
      raised the house, when Dougal was found lying dead within twa steps of the
      bed where his master&rsquo;s coffin was placed. As for the whistle, it was gaen
      anes and ay; but mony a time was it heard at the top of the house on the
      bartizan, and amang the auld chimneys and turrets where the howlets have
      their nests. Sir John hushed the matter up, and the funeral passed over
      without mair bogle-wark.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when a&rsquo; was ower, and the laird was beginning to settle his affairs,
      every tenant was called up for his arrears, and my gudesire for the full
      sum that stood against him in the rental-book. Weel, away he trots to the
      castle, to tell his story, and there he is introduced to Sir John, sitting
      in his father&rsquo;s chair, in deep mourning, with weepers and hanging cravat,
      and a small wallring rapier by his side, instead of the auld broadsword
      that had a hundredweight of steel about it, what with blade, chape, and
      basket-hilt. I have heard their communing so often tauld ower, that I
      almost think I was there mysell, though I couldna be born at the time. (In
      fact, Alan, my companion mimicked, with a good deal of humour, the
      flattering, conciliating tone of the tenant&rsquo;s address, and the
      hypocritical melancholy of the laird&rsquo;s reply. His grandfather, he said,
      had, while he spoke, his eye fixed on the rental-book, as if it were a
      mastiff-dog that he was afraid would spring up and bite him).
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wuss ye joy, sir, of the head seat, and the white loaf, and the braid
      lairdship. Your father was a kind man to friends and followers; muckle
      grace to you, Sir John, to fill his shoon&mdash;his boots, I suld say, for
      he seldom wore shoon, unless it were muils when he had the gout.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, Steenie,&rsquo; quoth the laird, sighing deeply, and putting his napkin to
      his een, &lsquo;his was a sudden call, and he will be missed in the country; no
      time to set his house in order&mdash;weel prepared Godward, no doubt,
      which is the root of the matter&mdash;but left us behind a tangled heap to
      wind, Steenie.&mdash;Hem! hem! We maun go to business, Steenie; much to
      do, and little time to do it in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he opened the fatal volume. I have heard of a thing they call
      Doomsday Book&mdash;I am clear it has been a rental of back-ganging
      tenants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stephen,&rsquo; said Sir John, still in the same soft, sleekit tone of voice&mdash;&lsquo;Stephen
      Stevenson, or Steenson, ye are down here for a year&rsquo;s rent behind the hand&mdash;due
      at last term.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      STEPHEN. &lsquo;Please your honour, Sir John, I paid it to your father.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR JOHN. &lsquo;Ye took a receipt, then, doubtless, Stephen; and can produce
      it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      STEPHEN. &lsquo;Indeed I hadna time, an it like your honour; for nae sooner had
      I set doun the siller, and just as his honour, Sir Robert, that&rsquo;s gaen,
      drew it till him to count it, and write out the receipt, he was ta&rsquo;en wi&rsquo; 
      the pains that removed him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That was unlucky,&rsquo; said Sir John, after a pause. &lsquo;But ye maybe paid it in
      the presence of somebody, I want but a TALIS QUALIS evidence, Stephen. I
      would go ower strictly to work with no poor man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      STEPHEN. &lsquo;Troth, Sir John, there was naebody in the room but Dougal
      MacCallum the butler. But, as your honour kens, he has e&rsquo;en followed his
      auld master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very unlucky again, Stephen,&rsquo; said Sir John, without altering his voice a
      single note. &lsquo;The man to whom ye paid the money is dead&mdash;and the man
      who witnessed the payment is dead too&mdash;and the siller, which should
      have been to the fore, is neither seen nor heard tell of in the
      repositories. How am I to believe a&rsquo; this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      STEPHEN. &lsquo;I dinna, ken, your honour; but there is a bit memorandum note of
      the very coins; for, God help me! I had to borrow out of twenty purses;
      and I am sure that ilka man there set down will take his grit oath for
      what purpose I borrowed the money.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR JOHN. &lsquo;I have little doubt ye BORROWED the money, Steenie. It is the
      PAYMENT to my father that I want to have some proof of.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      STEPHEN. &lsquo;The siller maun be about the house, Sir John. And since your
      honour never got it, and his honour that was canna have taen it wi&rsquo; him,
      maybe some of the family may have seen it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR JOHN. &lsquo;We will examine the servants, Stephen; that is but reasonable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But lackey and lass, and page and groom, all denied stoutly that they had
      ever seen such a bag of money as my gudesire described. What was waur, he
      had unluckily not mentioned to any living soul of them his purpose of
      paying his rent. Ae quean had noticed something under his arm, but she
      took it for the pipes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir John Redgauntlet ordered the servants out of the room, and then said
      to my gudesire, &lsquo;Now, Steenie, ye see ye have fair play; and, as I have
      little doubt ye ken better where to find the siller than ony other body, I
      beg, in fair terms, and for your own sake, that you will end this
      fasherie; for, Stephen, ye maun pay or flit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Lord forgie your opinion,&rsquo; said Stephen, driven almost to his wit&rsquo;s
      end&mdash;&lsquo;I am an honest man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So am I, Stephen,&rsquo; said his honour; &lsquo;and so are all the folks in the
      house, I hope. But if there be a knave amongst us, it must be he that
      tells the story he cannot prove.&rsquo; He paused, and then added, mair sternly,
      &lsquo;If I understand your trick, sir, you want to take advantage of some
      malicious reports concerning things in this family, and particularly
      respecting my father&rsquo;s sudden death, thereby to cheat me out of the money,
      and perhaps take away my character, by insinuating that I have received
      the rent I am demanding. Where do you suppose this money to be? I insist
      upon knowing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My gudesire saw everything look so muckle against him, that he grew nearly
      desperate&mdash;however, he shifted from one foot to another, looked to
      every corner of the room, and made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Speak out, sirrah,&rsquo; said the laird, assuming a look of his father&rsquo;s, a
      very particular ane, which he had when he was angry&mdash;it seemed as if
      the wrinkles of his frown made that selfsame fearful shape of a horse&rsquo;s
      shoe in the middle of his brow;&mdash;&lsquo;Speak out, sir! I WILL know your
      thoughts;&mdash;do you suppose that I have this money?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Far be it frae me to say so,&rsquo; said Stephen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you charge any of my people with having taken it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wad be laith to charge them that may be innocent,&rsquo; said my gudesire;
      &lsquo;and if there be any one that is guilty, I have nae proof.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Somewhere the money must be, if there is a word of truth in your story,&rsquo; 
      said Sir John; &lsquo;I ask where you think it is&mdash;and demand a correct
      answer?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In HELL, if you will have my thoughts of it,&rsquo; said my gudesire, driven to
      extremity, &lsquo;in hell! with your father, his jackanape, and his silver
      whistle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the stairs he ran (for the parlour was nae place for him after such a
      word) and he heard the laird swearing blood and wounds behind him, as
      fast; as ever did Sir Robert, and roaring for the bailie and the
      baron-officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away rode my gudesire to his chief creditor (him they ca&rsquo;d Laurie Lapraik)
      to try if he could make onything out of him; but when he tauld his story,
      he got but the worst word in his wame&mdash;thief, beggar, and dyvour,
      were the saftest terms; and to the boot of these hard terms, Laurie
      brought up the auld story of his dipping his hand in the blood of God&rsquo;s
      saunts, just as if a tenant could have helped riding with the laird, and
      that a laird like Sir Robert Redgauntlet. My gudesire was, by this time,
      far beyond the bounds of patience, and, while he and Laurie were at deil
      speed the liars, he was wanchancie aneugh to abuse Lapraik&rsquo;s doctrine as
      weel as the man, ond said things that garr&rsquo;d folks&rsquo; flesh grue that heard
      them;&mdash;he wasna just himsell, and he had lived wi&rsquo; a wild set in his
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they parted, and my gudesire was to ride hame through the wood of
      Pitmurkie, that is a&rsquo; fou of black firs, as they say.&mdash;I ken the
      wood, but the firs may be black or white for what I can tell.&mdash;At the
      entry of the wood there is a wild common, and on the edge of the common, a
      little lonely change-house, that was keepit then by an ostler-wife, they
      suld hae caa&rsquo;d her Tibbie Faw, and there puir Steenie cried for a mutchkin
      of brandy, for he had had no refreshment the haill day. Tibbie was earnest
      wi&rsquo; him to take a bite of meat, but he couldna think o&rsquo;t, nor would he
      take his foot out of the stirrup, and took off the brandy wholely at twa
      draughts, and named a toast at each:&mdash;the first was the memory of Sir
      Robert Redgauntlet, and might he never lie quiet in his grave till he had
      righted his poor bond-tenant; and the second was a health to Man&rsquo;s Enemy,
      if he would but get him back the pock of siller or tell him what came o&rsquo;t,
      for he saw the haill world was like to regard him as a thief and a cheat,
      and he took that waur than even the ruin of his house and hauld.
    </p>
    <p>
      On he rode, little caring where. It was a dark night turned, and the trees
      made it yet darker, and he let the beast take its ain road through the
      wood; when all of a sudden, from tired and wearied that it was before, the
      nag began to spring and flee, and stend, that my gudesire could hardly
      keep the saddle. Upon the whilk, a horseman, suddenly riding up beside
      him, said, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a mettle beast of yours, freend; will you sell him?&rsquo; So
      saying, he touched the horse&rsquo;s neck with his riding-wand, and it fell into
      its auld heigh-ho of a stumbling trot. &lsquo;But his spunk&rsquo;s soon out of him, I
      think,&rsquo; continued the stranger, &lsquo;and that is like mony a man&rsquo;s courage,
      that thinks he wad do great things till he come to the proof.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My gudesire scarce listened to this, but spurred his horse, with &lsquo;Gude
      e&rsquo;en to you, freend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But it&rsquo;s like the stranger was ane that doesna lightly yield his point;
      for, ride as Steenie liked, he was ay beside him at the selfsame pace. At
      last my gudesire, Steenie Steenson, grew half angry, and, to say the
      truth, half feared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it that ye want with me, freend?&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;If ye be a robber, I
      have nae money; if ye be a leal man, wanting company, I have nae heart to
      mirth or speaking; and if ye want to ken the road, I scarce ken it
      mysell.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you will tell me your grief,&rsquo; said the stranger, &lsquo;I am one that,
      though I have been sair miscaa&rsquo;d in the world, am the only hand for
      helping my freends.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So my gudesire, to ease his ain heart, mair than from any hope of help,
      told him the story from beginning to end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a hard pinch,&rsquo; said the stranger; &lsquo;but I think I can help you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you could lend the money, sir, and take a lang day&mdash;I ken nae
      other help on earth,&rsquo; said my gudesire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But there may be some under the earth,&rsquo; said the stranger. &lsquo;Come, I&rsquo;ll be
      frank wi&rsquo; you; I could lend you the money on bond, but you would maybe
      scruple my terms. Now, I can tell you, that your auld laird is disturbed
      in his grave by your curses, and the wailing of your family, and if ye
      daur venture to go to see him, he will give you the receipt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My gudesire&rsquo;s hair stood on end at this proposal, but he thought his
      companion might be some humoursome chield that was trying to frighten him,
      and might end with lending him the money. Besides, he was bauld wi&rsquo; 
      brandy, and desperate wi&rsquo; distress; and he said he had courage to go to
      the gate of hell, and a step farther, for that receipt. The stranger
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weel, they rode on through the thickest of the wood, when, all of a
      sudden, the horse stopped at the door of a great house; and, but that he
      knew the place was ten miles off, my father would have thought he was at
      Redgauntlet Castle. They rode into the outer courtyard, through the muckle
      faulding yetts and aneath the auld portcullis; and the whole front of the
      house was lighted, and there were pipes and fiddles, and as much dancing
      and deray within as used to be at Sir Robert&rsquo;s house at Pace and Yule, and
      such high seasons. They lap off, and my gudesire, as seemed to him,
      fastened his horse to the very ring he had tied him to that morning, when
      he gaed to wait on the young Sir John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God!&rsquo; said my gudesire, &lsquo;if Sir Robert&rsquo;s death be but a dream!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He knocked at the ha&rsquo; door just as he was wont, and his auld acquaintance,
      Dougal MacCallum&mdash;just after his wont, too,&mdash;came to open the
      door, and said, &lsquo;Piper Steenie, are ye there, lad? Sir Robert has been
      crying for you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My gudesire was like a man in a dream&mdash;he looked for the stranger,
      but he was gane for the time. At last he just tried to say, &lsquo;Ha! Dougal
      Driveower, are ye living? I thought ye had been dead.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never fash yoursell wi&rsquo; me,&rsquo; said Dougal, &lsquo;but look to yoursell; and see
      ye tak naethlng frae ony body here, neither meat, drink, or siller, except
      just the receipt that is your ain.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he led the way out through halls and trances that were weel
      kend to my gudesire, and into the auld oak parlour; and there was as much
      singing of profane sangs, and birling of red wine, and speaking blasphemy
      and sculduddry, as had ever been in Redgauntlet Castle when it was at the
      blithest.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, Lord take us in keeping, what a set of ghastly revellers they were
      that sat around that table! My gudesire kend mony that had long before
      gane to their place, for often had he piped to the most part in the hall
      of Redgauntlet. There was the fierce Middleton, and the dissolute Rothes,
      and the crafty Lauderdale; and Dalyell, with his bald head and a beard to
      his girdle; and Earlshall, with Cameron&rsquo;s blude on his hand; and wild
      Bonshaw, that tied blessed Mr. Cargill&rsquo;s limbs till the blude sprung; and
      Dunbarton Douglas, the twice-turned traitor baith to country and king.
      There was the Bluidy Advocate MacKenyie, who, for his worldly wit and
      wisdom had been to the rest as a god. And there was Claverhouse, as
      beautiful as when he lived, with his long, dark, curled locks streaming
      down over his laced buff-coat, and his left hand always on his right
      spule-blade, to hide the wound that the silver bullet had made. [See Note
      2.] He sat apart from them all, and looked at them with a melancholy,
      haughty countenance; while the rest hallooed, and sang, and laughed, that
      the room rang. But their smiles were fearfully contorted from time to
      time; and their laugh passed into such wild sounds as made my gudesire&rsquo;s
      very nails grow blue, and chilled the marrow in his banes.
    </p>
    <p>
      They that waited at the table were just the wicked serving-men and
      troopers, that had done their work and cruel bidding on earth. There was
      the Lang Lad of the Nethertown, that helped to take Argyle; and the
      bishop&rsquo;s summoner, that they called the Deil&rsquo;s Rattle-bag; and the wicked
      guardsmen in their laced coats; and the savage Highland Amorites, that
      shed blood like water; and many a proud serving-man, haughty of heart and
      bloody of hand, cringing to the rich, and making them wickeder than they
      would be; grinding the poor to powder, when the rich had broken them to
      fragments. And mony, mony mair were coming and ganging, a&rsquo; as busy in
      their vocation as if they had been alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Robert Redgauntlet, in the midst of a&rsquo; this fearful riot, cried, wi&rsquo; a
      voice like thunder, on Steenie Piper to come to the board-head where he
      was sitting; his legs stretched out before him, and swathed up with
      flannel, with his holster pistols aside him, while the great broadsword
      rested against his chair, just as my gudesire had seen him the last time
      upon earth&mdash;the very cushion for the jackanape was close to him, but
      the creature itself was not there&mdash;it wasna its hour, it&rsquo;s likely;
      for he heard them say as he came forward, &lsquo;Is not the major come yet?&rsquo; And
      another answered, &lsquo;The jackanape will be here betimes the morn.&rsquo; And when
      my gudesire came forward, Sir Robert, or his ghaist, or the deevil in his
      likeness, said, &lsquo;Weel, piper, hae ye settled wi&rsquo; my son for the year&rsquo;s
      rent?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With much ado my father gat breath to say that Sir John would not settle
      without his honour&rsquo;s receipt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ye shall hae that for a tune of the pipes, Steenie,&rsquo; said the appearance
      of Sir Robert&mdash;&lsquo;Play us up &ldquo;Weel hoddled, Luckie&rdquo;.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this was a tune my gudesire learned frae a warlock, that heard it when
      they were worshipping Satan at their meetings, and my gudesire had
      sometimes played it at the ranting suppers in Redgauntlet Castle, but
      never very willingly; and now he grew cauld at the very name of it, and
      said, for excuse, he hadna his pipes wi&rsquo; him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;MacCallum, ye limb of Beelzebub,&rsquo; said the fearfu&rsquo; Sir Robert, &lsquo;bring
      Steenie the pipes that I am keeping for him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      MacCallum brought a pair of pipes might have served the piper of Donald of
      the Isles. But he gave my gudesire a nudge as he offered them; and looking
      secretly and closely, Steenie saw that the chanter was of steel, and
      heated to a white heat; so he had fair warning not to trust his fingers
      with it. So he excused himself again, and said he was faint and
      frightened, and had not wind aneugh to fill the bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then ye maun eat and drink, Steenie,&rsquo; said the figure; &lsquo;for we do little
      else here; and it&rsquo;s ill speaking between a fou man and a fasting.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now these were the very words that the bloody Earl of Douglas said to keep
      the king&rsquo;s messenger in hand while he cut the head off MacLellan of
      Bombie, at the Threave Castle, [The reader is referred for particulars to
      Pitscottie&rsquo;s HISTORY OF SCOTLAND.] and that put Steenie mair and mair on
      his guard. So he spoke up like a man, and said he came neither to eat, or
      drink or make minstrelsy; but simply for his ain&mdash;to ken what was
      come o&rsquo; the money he had paid, and to get a discharge for it; and he was
      so stout-hearted by this time that he charged Sir Robert for
      conscience-sake (he had no power to say the holy name) and as he hoped for
      peace and rest, to spread no snares for him, but just to give him his ain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appearance gnashed its teeth and laughed, but it took from a large
      pocket-book the receipt, and handed it to Steenie. &lsquo;There is your receipt,
      ye pitiful cur; and for the money, my dog-whelp of a son may go look for
      it in the Cat&rsquo;s Cradle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My gudesire uttered mony thanks, and was about to retire when Sir Robert
      roared aloud, &lsquo;Stop, though, thou sack-doudling son of a whore! I am not
      done with thee. HERE we do nothing for nothing; and you must return on
      this very day twelvemonth, to pay your master the homage that you owe me
      for my protection.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father&rsquo;s tongue was loosed of a suddenty, and he said aloud, &lsquo;I refer
      mysell to God&rsquo;s pleasure, and not to yours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no sooner uttered the word than all was dark around him; and he
      sank on the earth with such a sudden shock, that he lost both breath and
      sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      How lang Steenie lay there, he could not tell; but when he came to
      himsell, he was lying in the auld kirkyard of Redgauntlet parochine just
      at the door of the family aisle, and the scutcheon of the auld knight, Sir
      Robert, hanging over his head. There was a deep morning fog on grass and
      gravestane around him, and his horse was feeding quietly beside the
      minister&rsquo;s twa cows. Steenie would have thought the whole was a dream, but
      he had the receipt in his hand, fairly written and signed by the auld
      laird; only the last letters of his name were a little disorderly, written
      like one seized with sudden pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sorely troubled in his mind, he left that dreary place, rode through the
      mist to Redgauntlet Castle, and with much ado he got speech of the laird.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, you dyvour bankrupt,&rsquo; was the first word, &lsquo;have you brought me my
      rent?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; answered my gudesire, &lsquo;I have not; but I have brought your honour
      Sir Robert&rsquo;s receipt for it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wow, sirrah? Sir Robert&rsquo;s receipt! You told me he had not given you one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will your honour please to see if that bit line is right?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir John looked at every line, and at every letter, with much attention;
      and at last, at the date, which my gudesire had not observed,&mdash;&lsquo;FROM
      MY APPOINTED PLACE,&rsquo; he read, &lsquo;THIS TWENTY-FIFTH OF NOVEMBER.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;What!
      That is yesterday!&mdash;Villain, thou must have gone to hell for this!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I got it from your honour&rsquo;s father&mdash;whether he be in heaven or hell,
      I know not,&rsquo; said Steenie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will delate you for a warlock to the Privy Council!&rsquo; said Sir John. &lsquo;I
      will send you to your master, the devil, with the help of a tar-barrel and
      a torch!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I intend to delate mysell to the Presbytery,&rsquo; said Steenie, &lsquo;and tell
      them all I have seen last night, whilk are things fitter for them to judge
      of than a borrel man like me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir John paused, composed himsell, and desired to hear the full history;
      and my gudesire told it him from point to point, as I have told it you&mdash;word
      for word, neither more nor less.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir John was silent again for a long time, and at last he said, very
      composedly, &lsquo;Steenie, this story of yours concerns the honour of many a
      noble family besides mine; and if it be a leasing-making, to keep yourself
      out of my danger, the least you can expect is to have a redhot iron driven
      through your tongue, and that will be as bad as scauding your fingers wi&rsquo; 
      a redhot chanter. But yet it may be true, Steenie; and if the money cast
      up I shall not know what to think of it. But where shall we find the Cat&rsquo;s
      Cradle? There are cats enough about the old house, but I think they kitten
      without the ceremony of bed or cradle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We were best ask Hutcheon,&rsquo; said my gudesire; &lsquo;he kens a&rsquo; the odd corners
      about as weel as&mdash;another serving-man that is now gane, and that I
      wad not like to name.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Aweel, Hutcheon, when he was asked, told them, that a ruinous turret, lang
      disused, next to the clock-house, only accessible by a ladder, for the
      opening was on the outside, and far above the battlements, was called of
      old the Cat&rsquo;s Cradle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There will I go immediately,&rsquo; said Sir John; and he took (with what
      purpose, Heaven kens) one of his father&rsquo;s pistols from the hall-table,
      where they had lain since the night he died, and hastened to the
      battlements.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a dangerous place to climb, for the ladder was auld and frail, and
      wanted ane or twa rounds. However, up got Sir John, and entered at the
      turret-door, where his body stopped the only little light that was in the
      bit turret. Something flees at him wi&rsquo; a vengeance, maist dang him back
      ower&mdash;bang gaed the knight&rsquo;s pistol, and Hutcheon, that held the
      ladder, and my gudesire that stood beside him, hears a loud skelloch. A
      minute after, Sir John flings the body of the jackanape down to them, and
      cries that the siller is fund, and that they should come up and help him.
      And there was the bag of siller sure aneugh, and mony orra thing besides,
      that had been missing for mony a day. And Sir John, when he had riped the
      turret weel, led my gudesire into the dining-parlour, and took him by the
      hand and spoke kindly to him, and said he was sorry he should have doubted
      his word and that he would hereafter be a good master to him to make
      amends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now, Steenie,&rsquo; said Sir John, &lsquo;although this vision of yours tend, on
      the whole, to my father&rsquo;s credit, as an honest man, that he should, even
      after his death, desire to see justice done to a poor man like you, yet
      you are sensible that ill-dispositioned men might make bad constructions
      upon it, concerning his soul&rsquo;s health. So, I think, we had better lay the
      haill dirdum on that ill-deedie creature, Major Weir, and say naething
      about your dream in the wood of Pitmurkie. You had taken ower muckle
      brandy to be very certain about onything; and, Steenie, this receipt&rsquo; (his
      hand shook while he held it out),&mdash;&lsquo;it&rsquo;s but a queer kind of
      document, and we will do best, I think, to put it quietly in the fire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Od, but for as queer as it is, it&rsquo;s a&rsquo; the voucher I have for my rent,&rsquo; 
      said my gudesire, who was afraid, it may be, of losing the benefit of Sir
      Robert&rsquo;s discharge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will bear the contents to your credit in the rental-book, and give you
      a discharge under my own hand,&rsquo; said Sir John, &lsquo;and that on the spot. And,
      Steenie, if you can hold your tongue about this matter, you shall sit,
      from this term downward, at an easier rent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mony thanks to your honour,&rsquo; said Steenie, who saw easily in what corner
      the wind was; &lsquo;doubtless I will be comformable to all your honour&rsquo;s
      commands; only I would willingly speak wi&rsquo; some powerful minister on the
      subject, for I do not like the sort of sommons of appointment whilk your
      honour&rsquo;s father&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not call the phantom my father!&rsquo; said Sir John, interrupting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Weel, then, the thing that was so like him,&rsquo; said my gudesire; &lsquo;he spoke
      of my coming back to see him this time twelvemonth, and it&rsquo;s a weight on
      my conscience.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aweel, then,&rsquo; said Sir John, &lsquo;if you be so much distressed in mind, you
      may speak to our minister of the parish; he is a douce man, regards the
      honour of our family, and the mair that he may look for some patronage
      from me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Wi&rsquo; that, my father readily agreed that the receipt should be burnt, and
      the laird threw it into the chimney with his ain hand. Burn it would not
      for them, though; but away it flew up the lum, wi&rsquo; a lang train of sparks
      at its tail, and a hissing noise like a squib.
    </p>
    <p>
      My gudesire gaed down to the Manse, and the minister, when he had heard
      the story, said it was his real opinion that though my gudesire had gaen
      very far in tampering with dangerous matters, yet, as he had refused the
      devil&rsquo;s arles (for such was the offer of meat and drink) and had refused
      to do homage by piping at his bidding, he hoped, that if he held a
      circumspect walk hereafter, Satan could take little advantage by what was
      come and gane. And, indeed, my gudesire, of his ain accord, lang foreswore
      baith the pipes and the brandy&mdash;it was not even till the year was
      out, and the fatal day past, that he would so much as take the fiddle, or
      drink usquebaugh or tippeny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir John made up his story about the jackanape as he liked himsell; and
      some believe till this day there was no more in the matter than the
      filching nature of the brute. Indeed, ye&rsquo;ll no hinder some to threap that
      it was nane o&rsquo; the auld Enemy that Dougal and my gudesire saw in the
      laird&rsquo;s room, but only that wanchancy creature, the major, capering on the
      coffin; and that, as to the blawing on the laird&rsquo;s whistle that was heard
      after he was dead, the filthy brute could do that as weel as the laird
      himsell, if no better. But Heaven kens the truth, whilk first came out by
      the minister&rsquo;s wife, after Sir John and her ain gudeman were baith in the
      moulds. And then my gudesire, wha was failed in his limbs, but not in his
      judgement or memory&mdash;at least nothing to speak of&mdash;was obliged
      to tell the real narrative to his friends, for the credit of his good
      name. He might else have been charged for a warlock. [See Note 3.]
    </p>
    <p>
      The shades of evening were growing thicker around us as my conductor
      finished his long narrative with this moral&mdash;&lsquo;Ye see, birkie, it is
      nae chancy thing to tak a stranger traveller for a guide, when you are in
      an uncouth land.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should not have made that inference,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;Your grandfather&rsquo;s
      adventure was fortunate for himself, whom it saved from ruin and distress;
      and fortunate for his landlord also, whom it prevented from committing a
      gross act of injustice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, but they had baith to sup the sauce o&rsquo;t sooner or later,&rsquo; said
      Wandering Willie&mdash;&lsquo;what was fristed wasna forgiven. Sir John died
      before he was much over three-score; and it was just like of a moment&rsquo;s
      illness. And for my gudesire, though he departed in fullness of life, yet
      there was my father, a yauld man of forty-five, fell down betwixt the
      stilts of his pleugh, and rase never again, and left nae bairn but me, a
      puir sightless, fatherless, motherless creature, could neither work nor
      want. Things gaed weel aneugh at first; for Sir Redwald Redgauntlet, the
      only son of Sir John, and the oye of auld Sir Robert, and, waes me! the
      last of the honourable house, took the farm aff our hands, and brought me
      into his household to have care of me. He liked music, and I had the best
      teachers baith England and Scotland could gie me. Mony a merry year was I
      wi&rsquo; him; but waes me! he gaed out with other pretty men in the Forty-five&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      say nae mair about it&mdash;My head never settled weel since I lost him;
      and if I say another word about it, deil a bar will I have the heart to
      play the night.&mdash;Look out, my gentle chap,&rsquo; he resumed in a different
      tone, &lsquo;ye should see the lights at Brokenburn glen by this time.&rsquo;

  Tam Luter was their minstrel meet,

</pre>
    <p>
      I continue to scribble at length, though the subject may seem somewhat
      deficient in interest. Let the grace of the narrative, therefore, and the
      concern we take in each other&rsquo;s matters, make amends for its tenuity. We
      fools of fancy who suffer ourselves, like Malvolio, to be cheated with our
      own visions, have, nevertheless, this advantage over the wise ones of the
      earth, that we have our whole stock of enjoyments under our own command,
      and can dish for ourselves an intellectual banquet with most moderate
      assistance from external objects. It is, to be sure, something like the
      feast which the Barmecide served up to Alnaschar; and we cannot expect to
      get fat upon such diet. But then, neither is there repletion nor nausea,
      which often succeed the grosser and more material revel. On the whole, I
      still pray, with the Ode to Castle Building&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Give me thy hope which sickens not the heart;
    Give me thy wealth which has no wings to fly;
  Give me the bliss thy visions can impart:
    Thy friendship give me, warm in poverty!
</pre>
    <p>
      And so, despite thy solemn smile and sapient shake of the head, I will go
      on picking such interest as I can out of my trivial adventures, even
      though that interest should be the creation of my own fancy; nor will I
      cease to indict on thy devoted eyes the labour of perusing the scrolls in
      which I shall record my narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      My last broke off as we were on the point of descending into the glen at
      Brokenburn, by the dangerous track which I had first travelled EN CROUPE,
      behind a furious horseman, and was now again to brave under the precarious
      guidance of a blind man.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now getting dark; but this was no inconvenience to my guide, who
      moved on, as formerly, with instinctive security of step, so that we soon
      reached the bottom, and I could see lights twinkling in the cottage which
      had been my place of refuge on a former occasion. It was not thither,
      however, that our course was directed. We left the habitation of the laird
      to the left, and turning down the brook, soon approached the small hamlet
      which had been erected at the mouth of the stream, probably on account of
      the convenience which it afforded as a harbour to the fishing-boats. A
      large, low cottage, full in our front, seemed highly illuminated; for the
      light not only glanced from every window and aperture in its frail walls,
      but was even visible from rents and fractures in the roof, composed of
      tarred shingles, repaired in part by thatch and divot.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these appearances engaged my attention, that of my companion was
      attracted by a regular succession of sounds, like a bouncing on the floor,
      mixed with a very faint noise of music, which Willie&rsquo;s acute organs at
      once recognized and accounted for, while to me it was almost inaudible.
      The old man struck the earth with his staff in a violent passion. &lsquo;The
      whoreson fisher rabble! They have brought another violer upon my walk!
      They are such smuggling blackguards, that they must run in their very
      music; but I&rsquo;ll sort them waur than ony gauger in the country.&mdash;Stay&mdash;hark&mdash;it
      &lsquo;s no a fiddle neither&mdash;it&rsquo;s the pipe and tabor bastard, Simon of
      Sowport, frae the Nicol Forest; but I&rsquo;ll pipe and tabor him!&mdash;Let me
      hae ance my left hand on his cravat, and ye shall see what my right will
      do. Come away, chap&mdash;come away, gentle chap&mdash;nae time to be
      picking and waling your steps.&rsquo; And on he passed with long and determined
      strides, dragging me along with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not quite easy in his company; for, now that his minstrel pride was
      hurt, the man had changed from the quiet, decorous, I might almost say
      respectable person, which he seemed while he told his tale, into the
      appearance of a fierce, brawling, dissolute stroller. So that when he
      entered the large hut, where a great number of fishers, with their wives
      and daughters, were engaged in eating, drinking, and dancing, I was
      somewhat afraid that the impatient violence of my companion might procure
      us an indifferent reception.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the universal shout of welcome with which Wandering Willie was
      received&mdash;the hearty congratulations&mdash;the repeated &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s t&rsquo; 
      ye, Willie!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Where hae ya been, ye blind deevil?&rsquo; and the call upon
      him to pledge them&mdash;above all, the speed with which the obnoxious
      pipe and tabor were put to silence, gave the old man such effectual
      assurance of undiminished popularity and importance, as at once put his
      jealousy to rest, and changed his tone of offended dignity into one better
      fitted to receive such cordial greetings. Young men and women crowded
      round, to tell how much they were afraid some mischance had detained him,
      and how two or three young fellows had set out in quest of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was nae mischance, praised be Heaven,&rsquo; said Willie, &lsquo;but the absence
      of the lazy loon Rob the Rambler, my comrade, that didna come to meet me
      on the Links; but I hae gotten a braw consort in his stead, worth a dozen
      of him, the unhanged blackguard.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And wha is&rsquo;t tou&rsquo;s gotten, Wullie, lad?&rsquo; said half a score of voices,
      while all eyes were turned on your humble servant, who kept the best
      countenance he could, though not quite easy at becoming the centre to
      which all eyes were pointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I ken him by his hemmed cravat,&rsquo; said one fellow; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s Gil Hobson, the
      souple tailor frae Burgh. Ye are welcome to Scotland, ye prick-the-clout
      loon,&rsquo; he said, thrusting forth a paw; much the colour of a badger&rsquo;s back,
      and of most portentous dimensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gil Hobson? Gil whoreson!&rsquo; exclaimed Wandering Willie; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s a gentle
      chap that I judge to be an apprentice wi&rsquo; auld Joshua Geddes, to the
      quaker-trade.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What trade be&rsquo;s that, man?&rsquo; said he of the badger-coloured fist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Canting and lying,&rsquo;&mdash;said Willie, which produced a thundering laugh;
      &lsquo;but I am teaching the callant a better trade, and that is, feasting and
      fiddling.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Willie&rsquo;s conduct in thus announcing something like my real character, was
      contrary to compact; and yet I was rather glad he did so, for the
      consequence of putting a trick upon these rude and ferocious men, might,
      in case of discovery, have been dangerous to us both, and I was at the
      same time delivered from the painful effort to support a fictitious
      character. The good company, except perhaps one or two of the young women
      whose looks expressed some desire for better acquaintance, gave themselves
      no further trouble about me; but, while the seniors resumed their places
      near an immense bowl or rather reeking cauldron of brandy-punch, the
      younger arranged themselves on the floor and called loudly on Willie to
      strike up.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a brief caution to me, to &lsquo;mind my credit, for fishers have ears,
      though fish have none,&rsquo; Willie led off in capital style, and I followed,
      certainly not so as to disgrace my companion, who, every now and then,
      gave me a nod of approbation. The dances were, of course, the Scottish
      jigs, and reels, and &lsquo;twasome dances&rsquo;, with a strathspey or hornpipe for
      interlude; and the want of grace on the part of the performers was amply
      supplied by truth of ear, vigour and decision of step, and the agility
      proper to the northern performers. My own spirits rose with the mirth
      around me, and with old Willie&rsquo;s admirable execution, and frequent &lsquo;weel
      dune, gentle chap, yet;&rsquo;&mdash;and, to confess the truth, I felt a great
      deal more pleasure in this rustic revel, than I have done at the more
      formal balls and concerts in your famed city, to which I have sometimes
      made my way. Perhaps this was because I was a person of more importance to
      the presiding matron of Brokenburn-foot, than I had the means of rendering
      myself to the far-famed Miss Nickie Murray, the patroness of your
      Edinburgh assemblies. The person I mean was a buxom dame of about thirty,
      her fingers loaded with many a silver ring, and three or four of gold; her
      ankles liberally displayed from under her numerous blue, white, and
      scarlet; short petticoats, and attired in hose of the finest and whitest
      lamb&rsquo;s-wool, which arose from shoes of Spanish cordwain, fastened with
      silver buckles. She took the lead in my favour, and declared, &lsquo;that the
      brave young gentleman should not weary himself to death wi&rsquo; playing, but
      take the floor for a dance or twa.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what&rsquo;s to come of me, Dame Martin?&rsquo; said Willie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come o&rsquo; thee?&rsquo; said the dame; &lsquo;mishanter on the auld beard o&rsquo; ye! ye
      could play for twenty hours on end, and tire out the haill countryside wi&rsquo; 
      dancing before ye laid down your bow, saving for a by-drink or the like o&rsquo; 
      that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In troth, dame,&rsquo; answered Willie, &lsquo;ye are no sae far wrang; sae if my
      comrade is to take his dance, ye maun gie me my drink, and then bob it
      away like Madge of Middlebie.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The drink was soon brought; but while Willie was partaking of it, a party
      entered the hut, which arrested my attention at once, and intercepted the
      intended gallantry with which I had proposed to present my hand to the
      fresh-coloured, well-made, white-ankled Thetis, who had obtained me
      manumission from my musical task.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was nothing less than the sudden appearance of the old woman whom the
      laird had termed Mabel; Cristal Nixon, his male attendant; and the young
      person who had said grace to us when I supped with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This young person&mdash;Alan, thou art in thy way a bit of a conjurer&mdash;this
      young person whom I DID NOT describe, and whom you, for that very reason,
      suspected was not an indifferent object to me&mdash;is, I am sorry to say
      it, in very fact not so much so as in prudence she ought. I will not use
      the name of love on this occasion; for I have applied it too often to
      transient whims and fancies to escape your satire, should I venture to
      apply it now. For it is a phrase, I must confess, which I have used&mdash;a
      romancer would say, profaned&mdash;a little too often, considering how few
      years have passed over my head. But seriously, the fair chaplain of
      Brokenburn has been often in my head when she had no business there; and
      if this can give thee any clue for explaining my motives in lingering
      about the country, and assuming the character of Willie&rsquo;s companion, why,
      hang thee, thou art welcome to make use of it&mdash;a permission for which
      thou need&rsquo;st not thank me much, as thou wouldst not have failed to assume
      it whether it were given or no.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such being my feelings, conceive how they must have been excited, when,
      like a beam upon a cloud, I saw this uncommonly beautiful girl enter the
      apartment in which they were dancing; not, however, with the air of an
      equal, but that of a superior, come to grace with her presence the
      festival of her dependants. The old man and woman attended, with looks as
      sinister as hers were lovely, like two of the worst winter months waiting
      upon the bright-eyed May.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she entered&mdash;wonder if thou wilt&mdash;she wore A GREEN MANTLE,
      such as thou hast described as the garb of thy fair client, and confirmed
      what I had partly guessed from thy personal description, that my chaplain
      and thy visitor were the same person. There was an alteration on her brow
      the instant she recognized me. She gave her cloak to her female attendant,
      and, after a momentary hesitation, as if uncertain whether to advance or
      retire, she walked into the room with dignity and composure, all making
      way, the men unbonneting, and the women curtsying respectfully, as she
      assumed a chair which was reverently placed for her accommodation, apart
      from others.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was then a pause, until the bustling mistress of the ceremonies,
      with awkward but kindly courtesy, offered the young lady a glass of wine,
      which was at first declined, and at length only thus far accepted, that,
      bowing round to the festive company, the fair visitor wished them all
      health and mirth, and just touching the brim with her lip, replaced it on
      the salver. There was another pause; and I did not immediately recollect,
      confused as I was by this unexpected apparition, that it belonged to me to
      break it. At length a murmur was heard around me, being expected to
      exhibit,&mdash;nay, to lead down the dance,&mdash;in consequence of the
      previous conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Deil&rsquo;s in the fiddler lad,&rsquo; was muttered from more quarters than one&mdash;&lsquo;saw
      folk ever sic a thing as a shame-faced fiddler before?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At length a venerable Triton, seconding his remonstrances with a hearty
      thump on my shoulder, cried out, &lsquo;To the floor&mdash;to the floor, and let
      us see how ye can fling&mdash;the lasses are a&rsquo; waiting.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Up I jumped, sprang from the elevated station which constituted our
      orchestra, and, arranging my ideas as rapidly as I could, advanced to the
      head of the room, and, instead of offering my hand to the white-footed
      Thetis aforesaid, I venturously made the same proposal to her of the Green
      Mantle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nymph&rsquo;s lovely eyes seemed to open with astonishment at the audacity
      of this offer; and, from the murmurs I heard around me, I also understood
      that it surprised, and perhaps offended, the bystanders. But after the
      first moment&rsquo;s emotion, she wreathed her neck, and drawing herself
      haughtily up, like one who was willing to show that she was sensible of
      the full extent of her own condescension, extended her hand towards me,
      like a princess gracing a squire of low degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is affectation in all this, thought I to myself, if the Green Mantle
      has borne true evidence&mdash;for young ladies do not make visits, or
      write letters to counsel learned in the law, to interfere in the motions
      of those whom they hold as cheap as this nymph seems to do me; and if I am
      cheated by a resemblance of cloaks, still I am interested to show myself,
      in some degree, worthy of the favour she has granted with so much state
      and reserve. The dance to be performed was the old Scots Jig, in which you
      are aware I used to play no sorry figure at La Pique&rsquo;s, when thy clumsy
      movements used to be rebuked by raps over the knuckles with that great
      professor&rsquo;s fiddlestick. The choice of the tune was left to my comrade
      Willie, who, having finished his drink, feloniously struck up the
      well-known and popular measure,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Merrily danced the Quaker&rsquo;s wife,
  And merrily danced the Quaker.
</pre>
    <p>
      An astounding laugh arose at my expense, and I should have been
      annihilated, but that the smile which mantled on the lip of my partner,
      had a different expression from that of ridicule, and seemed to say, &lsquo;Do
      not take this to heart.&rsquo; And I did not, Alan&mdash;my partner danced
      admirably, and I like one who was determined, if outshone, which I could
      not help, not to be altogether thrown into the shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      I assure you our performance, as well as Willie&rsquo;s music, deserved more
      polished spectators and auditors; but we could not then have been greeted
      with such enthusiastic shouts of applause as attended while I handed my
      partner to her seat, and took my place by her side, as one who had a right
      to offer the attentions usual on such an occasion. She was visibly
      embarrassed, but I was determined not to observe her confusion, and to
      avail myself of the opportunity of learning whether this beautiful
      creature&rsquo;s mind was worthy of the casket in which nature had lodged it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, however courageously I formed this resolution, you cannot
      but too well guess the difficulties I must needs have felt in carrying it
      into execution; since want of habitual intercourse with the charmers of
      the other sex has rendered me a sheepish cur, only one grain less awkward
      than thyself. Then she was so very beautiful, and assumed an air of so
      much dignity, that I was like to fall under the fatal error of supposing
      she should only be addressed with something very clever; and in the hasty
      raking which my brains underwent in this persuasion, not a single idea
      occurred that common sense did not reject as fustian on the one hand, or
      weary, flat, and stale triticism on the other. I felt as if my
      understanding were no longer my own, but was alternately under the
      dominion of Aldeborontiphoscophornio, and that of his facetious friend
      Rigdum-Funnidos. How did I envy at that moment our friend Jack Oliver, who
      produces with such happy complacence his fardel of small talk, and who, as
      he never doubts his own powers of affording amusement, passes them current
      with every pretty woman he approaches, and fills up the intervals of chat
      by his complete acquaintance with the exercise of the fan, the FLACON, and
      the other duties of the CAVALIERE SERVENTE. Some of these I attempted, but
      I suppose it was awkwardly; at least the Lady Green Mantle received them
      as a princess accepts the homage of a clown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the floor remained empty, and as the mirth of the good meeting
      was somewhat checked, I ventured, as a DERNIER RESSORT, to propose a
      minuet. She thanked me, and told me haughtily enough, &lsquo;she was here to
      encourage the harmless pleasures of these good folks, but was not disposed
      to make an exhibition of her own indifferent dancing for their amusement.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused a moment, as if she expected me to suggest something; and as I
      remained silent and rebuked, she bowed her head more graciously, and said,
      &lsquo;Not to affront you, however, a country-dance, if you please.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      What an ass was I, Alan, not to have anticipated her wishes! Should I not
      have observed that the ill-favoured couple, Mabel and Cristal, had placed
      themselves on each side of her seat, like the supporters of the royal
      arms? the man, thick, short, shaggy, and hirsute, as the lion; the female,
      skin-dried, tight-laced, long, lean, and hungry-faced, like the unicorn. I
      ought to have recollected, that under the close inspection of two such
      watchful salvages, our communication, while in repose, could not have been
      easy; that the period of dancing a minuet was not the very choicest time
      for conversation; but that the noise, the exercise, and the mazy confusion
      of a country-dance, where the inexperienced performers were every now and
      then running against each other, and compelling the other couples to stand
      still for a minute at a time, besides the more regular repose afforded by
      the intervals of the dance itself, gave the best possible openings for a
      word or two spoken in season, and without being liable to observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had but just led down, when an opportunity of the kind occurred, and my
      partner said, with great gentleness and modesty, &lsquo;It is not perhaps very
      proper in me to acknowledge an acquaintance that is not claimed; but I
      believe I speak to Mr. Darsie Latimer?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Darsie Latimer was indeed the person that had now the honour and
      happiness&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I would have gone on in the false gallop of compliment, but she cut me
      short. &lsquo;And why,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;is Mr. Latimer here, and in disguise, or at
      least assuming an office unworthy of a man of education?&mdash;I beg
      pardon,&rsquo; she continued,&mdash;&lsquo;I would not give you pain, but surely
      making, an associate of a person of that description&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked towards my friend Willie, and was silent. I felt heartily
      ashamed of myself, and hastened to say it was an idle frolic, which want
      of occupation had suggested, and which I could not regret, since it had
      procured me the pleasure I at present enjoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without seeming to notice my compliment, she took the next opportunity to
      say, &lsquo;Will Mr. Latimer permit a stranger who wishes him well to ask,
      whether it is right that, at his active age, he should be in so far void
      of occupation, as to be ready to adopt low society for the sake of idle
      amusement?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are severe, madam,&rsquo; I answered; &lsquo;but I cannot think myself degraded
      by mixing with any society where I meet&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here I stopped short, conscious that I was giving my answer an unhandsome
      turn. The ARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM, the last to which a polite man has
      recourse, may, however, be justified by circumstances, but seldom or never
      the ARGUMENTUM AD FOEMINAM.
    </p>
    <p>
      She filled up the blank herself which I had left. &lsquo;Where you meet ME, I
      suppose you would say? But the case is different. I am, from my unhappy
      fate, obliged to move by the will of others, and to be in places which I
      would by my own will gladly avoid. Besides, I am, except for these few
      minutes, no participator of the revels&mdash;a spectator only, and
      attended by my servants. Your situation is different&mdash;you are here by
      choice, the partaker and minister of the pleasures of a class below you in
      education, birth, and fortunes. If I speak harshly, Mr. Latimer,&rsquo; she
      added, with much sweetness of manner, &lsquo;I mean kindly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was confounded by her speech, &lsquo;severe in youthful wisdom&rsquo;; all of naive
      or lively, suitable to such a dialogue, vanished from my recollection, and
      I answered with gravity like her own, &lsquo;I am, indeed, better educated than
      these poor people; but you, madam, whose kind admonition I am grateful
      for, must know more of my condition than I do myself&mdash;I dare not say
      I am their superior in birth, since I know nothing of my own, or in
      fortunes, over which hangs an impenetrable cloud.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And why should your ignorance on these points drive you into low society
      and idle habits?&rsquo; answered my female monitor. &lsquo;Is it manly to wait till
      fortune cast her beams upon you, when by exertion of your own energy you
      might distinguish yourself? Do not the pursuits of learning lie open to
      you&mdash;of manly ambition&mdash;of war? But no&mdash;not of war, that
      has already cost you too dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will be what you wish me to be,&rsquo; I replied with eagerness&mdash;&lsquo;You
      have but to choose my path, and you shall see if I do not pursue it with
      energy, were it only because you command me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not because I command you,&rsquo; said the maiden, &lsquo;but because reason, common
      sense, manhood, and, in one word, regard for your own safety, give the
      same counsel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At least permit me to reply, that reason and sense never assumed a fairer
      form&mdash;of persuasion,&rsquo; I hastily added; for she turned from me&mdash;nor
      did she give me another opportunity of continuing what I had to say till
      the next pause of the dance, when, determined to bring our dialogue to a
      point, I said, &lsquo;You mentioned manhood also, and in the same breath,
      personal danger. My ideas of manhood suggest that it is cowardice to
      retreat before dangers of a doubtful character. You, who appear to know so
      much of my fortunes that I might call you my guardian angel, tell me what
      these dangers are, that I may judge whether manhood calls on me to face or
      to fly them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was evidently perplexed by this appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You make me pay dearly for acting as your humane adviser,&rsquo; she replied at
      last: &lsquo;I acknowledge an interest in your fate, and yet I dare not tell you
      whence it arises; neither am I at liberty to say why, or from whom, you
      are in danger; but it is not less true that danger is near and imminent.
      Ask me no more, but, for your own sake, begone from this country.
      Elsewhere you are safe&mdash;here you do but invite your fate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But am I doomed to bid thus farewell to almost the only human being who
      has showed an interest in my welfare? Do not say so&mdash;say that we
      shall meet again, and the hope shall be the leading star to regulate my
      course!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is more than probable,&rsquo; she said&mdash;&lsquo;much more than probable, that
      we may never meet again. The help which I now render you is all that may
      be in my power; it is such as I should render to a blind man whom I might
      observe approaching the verge of a precipice; it ought to excite no
      surprise, and requires no gratitude.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, she again turned from me, nor did she address me until the
      dance was on the point of ending, when she said, &lsquo;Do not attempt to speak
      to or approach me again in the course of the night; leave the company as
      soon as you can, but not abruptly, and God be with you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I handed her to her seat, and did not quit the fair palm I held, without
      expressing my feelings by a gentle pressure. She coloured slightly, and
      withdrew her hand, but not angrily. Seeing the eyes of Cristal and Mabel
      sternly fixed on me, I bowed deeply, and withdrew from her; my heart
      saddening, and my eyes becoming dim in spite of me, as the shifting crowd
      hid us from each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was my intention to have crept back to my comrade Willie, and resumed
      my bow with such spirit as I might, although, at the moment, I would have
      given half my income for an instant&rsquo;s solitude. But my retreat was cut off
      by Dame Martin, with the frankness&mdash;if it is not an inconsistent
      phrase-of rustic coquetry, that goes straight up to the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, lad, ye seem unco sune weary, to dance sae lightly? Better the nag
      that ambles a&rsquo; the day, than him that makes a brattle for a mile, and
      then&rsquo;s dune wi&rsquo; the road.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a fair challenge, and I could not decline accepting it. Besides,
      I could see Dame Martin was queen of the revels; and so many were the rude
      and singular figures about me, that I was by no means certain whether I
      might not need some protection. I seized on her willing hand, and we took
      our places in the dance, where, if I did not acquit myself with all the
      accuracy of step and movement which I had before attempted, I at least
      came up to the expectations of my partner, who said, and almost swore, &lsquo;I
      was prime at it;&rsquo; while, stimulated to her utmost exertions, she herself
      frisked like a kid, snapped her fingers like castanets, whooped like a
      Bacchanal, and bounded from the floor like a tennis-ball,&mdash;aye, till
      the colour of her garters was no particular mystery. She made the less
      secret of this, perhaps, that they were sky-blue, and fringed with silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time has been that this would have been special fun; or rather, last
      night was the only time I can recollect these four years when it would not
      have been so; yet, at this moment, I cannot tell you how I longed to be
      rid of Dame Martin. I almost wished she would sprain one of those
      &lsquo;many-twinkling&rsquo; ankles, which served her so alertly; and when, in the
      midst of her exuberant caprioling, I saw my former partner leaving the
      apartment, and with eyes, as I thought, turning towards me, this
      unwillingness to carry on the dance increased to such a point, that I was
      almost about to feign a sprain or a dislocation myself, in order to put an
      end to the performance. But there were around me scores of old women, all
      of whom looked as if they might have some sovereign recipe for such an
      accident; and, remembering Gil Blas, and his pretended disorder in the
      robber&rsquo;s cavern, I thought it as wise to play Dame Martin fair, and dance
      till she thought proper to dismiss me. What I did I resolved to do
      strenuously, and in the latter part of the exhibition I cut and sprang
      from the floor as high and as perpendicularly as Dame Martin herself; and
      received, I promise you, thunders of applause, for the common people
      always prefer exertion and agility to grace. At length Dame Martin could
      dance no more, and, rejoicing at my release, I led her to a seat, and took
      the privilege of a partner to attend her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hegh, sirs,&rsquo; exclaimed Dame Martin, &lsquo;I am sair forfoughen! Troth!
      callant, I think ye hae been amaist the death o&rsquo; me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I could only atone for the alleged offence by fetching her some
      refreshment, of which she readily partook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been lucky in my partners,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;first that pretty young lady,
      and then you, Mrs. Martin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hout wi&rsquo; your fleeching,&rsquo; said Dame Martin. &lsquo;Gae wa&mdash;gae wa, lad;
      dinna blaw in folk&rsquo;s lugs that gate; me and Miss Lilias even&rsquo;d thegither!
      Na, na, lad&mdash;od, she is maybe four or five years younger than the
      like o&rsquo; me,&mdash;bye and attour her gentle havings.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is the laird&rsquo;s daughter?&rsquo; said I, in as careless a tone of inquiry as
      I could assume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His daughter, man? Na, na, only his niece&mdash;and sib aneugh to him, I
      think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, indeed,&rsquo; I replied; &lsquo;I thought she had borne his name?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She bears her ain name, and that&rsquo;s Lilias.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And has she no other name?&rsquo; asked I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What needs she another till she gets a gudeman?&rsquo; answered my Thetis, a
      little miffed perhaps&mdash;to use the women&rsquo;s phrase&mdash;that I turned
      the conversation upon my former partner, rather than addressed it to
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a little pause, which was interrupted by Dame Martin observing,
      &lsquo;They are standing up again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;True,&rsquo; said I, having no mind to renew my late violent CAPRIOLE, and I
      must go help old Willie.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ere I could extricate myself, I heard poor Thetis address herself to a
      sort of merman in a jacket of seaman&rsquo;s blue, and a pair of trousers (whose
      hand, by the way, she had rejected at an earlier part of the evening) and
      intimate that she was now disposed to take a trip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Trip away, then, dearie,&rsquo; said the vindictive man of the waters, without
      offering his hand; &lsquo;there,&rsquo; pointing to the floor, &lsquo;is a roomy berth for
      you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain I had made one enemy, and perhaps two, I hastened to my original
      seat beside Willie, and began to handle my bow. But I could see that my
      conduct had made an unfavourable impression; the words, &lsquo;flory conceited
      chap,&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;hafflins gentle,&rsquo; and at length, the still more alarming
      epithet of &lsquo;spy,&rsquo; began to be buzzed about, and I was heartily glad when
      the apparition of Sam&rsquo;s visage at the door, who was already possessed of
      and draining a can of punch, gave me assurance that my means of retreat
      were at hand. I intimated as much to Willie, who probably had heard more
      of the murmurs of the company than I had, for he whispered, &lsquo;Aye, aye,&mdash;awa
      wi&rsquo; ye&mdash;ower lang here&mdash;slide out canny&mdash;dinna let them see
      ye are on the tramp.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I slipped half a guinea into the old man&rsquo;s hand, who answered, &lsquo;Truts
      pruts! nonsense but I &lsquo;se no refuse, trusting ye can afford it. Awa wi&rsquo; ye&mdash;and
      if ony body stops ye, cry on me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I glided, by his advice, along the room as if looking for a partner,
      joined Sam, whom I disengaged with some difficulty from his can, and we
      left the cottage together in a manner to attract the least possible
      observation. The horses were tied in a neighbouring shed, and as the moon
      was up, and I was now familiar with the road, broken and complicated as it
      is, we soon reached the Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush, where the old landlady was
      sitting up waiting for us, under some anxiety of mind, to account for
      which she did not hesitate to tell me that some folks had gone to
      Brokenburn from her house, or neighbouring towns, that did not come so
      safe back again. &lsquo;Wandering Willie,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;was doubtless a kind of
      protection.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Willie&rsquo;s wife, who was smoking in the chimney corner, took up the
      praises of her &lsquo;hinnie,&rsquo; as she called him, and endeavoured to awaken my
      generosity afresh, by describing the dangers from which, as she was
      pleased to allege, her husband&rsquo;s countenance had assuredly been the means
      of preserving me. I was not, however, to be fooled out of more money at
      this time, and went to bed in haste, full of vanous cogitations.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have since spent a couple of days betwixt Mount Sharon and this place,
      and betwixt reading, writing to thee this momentous history, forming plans
      for seeing the lovely Lilias, and&mdash;partly, I think, for the sake of
      contradiction&mdash;angling a little in spite of Joshua&rsquo;a scruples&mdash;though
      I am rather liking the amusement better as I begin to have some success in
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, my dearest Alan, you are in full possession of my secret&mdash;let
      me as frankly into the recesses of your bosom. How do you feel towards
      this fair ignis fatuus, this lily of the desert? Tell me honestly; for
      however the recollection of her may haunt my own mind, my love for Alan
      Fairford surpasses the love of woman, I know, too, that when you DO love,
      it will be to
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Love once and love no more.
</pre>
    <p>
      A deep-consuming passion, once kindled in a breast so steady as yours,
      would never be extinguished but with life. I am of another and more
      volatile temper, and though I shall open your next with a trembling hand
      and uncertain heart, yet let it bring a frank confession that this fair
      unknown has made a deeper impression on your gravity than you reckoned
      for, and you will see I can tear the arrow from my own wound, barb and
      all. In the meantime, though I have formed schemes once more to see her, I
      will, you may rely on it, take no step for putting them into practice. I
      have refrained from this hitherto, and I give you my word of honour, I
      shall continue to do so; yet why should you need any further assurance
      from one who is so entirely yours as D.L.
    </p>
    <p>
      PS.&mdash;I shall be on thorns till I receive your answer. I read, and
      re-read your letter, and cannot for my soul discover what your real
      sentiments are. Sometimes I think you write of her as one in jest&mdash;and
      sometimes I think that cannot be. Put me at ease as soon as possible.

    <h2>
      LETTER XIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      ALAN FAIRFORD TO DARSIE LATIMER
    </h3>
    <p>
      I write on the instant, as you direct; and in a tragi-comic humour, for I
      have a tear in my eye and a smile on my cheek. Dearest Darsie, sure never
      a being but yourself could be so generous&mdash;sure never a being but
      yourself could be so absurd! I remember when you were a boy you wished to
      make your fine new whip a present to old Aunt Peggy, merely because she
      admired it; and now, with like unreflecting and inappropriate liberality,
      you would resign your beloved to a smoke-dried young sophister, who cares
      not one of the hairs which it is his occupation to split, for all the
      daughters of Eve. I in love with your Lilias&mdash;your Green Mantle&mdash;your
      unknown enchantress!&mdash;why I scarce saw her for five minutes, and even
      then only the tip of her chin was distinctly visible. She was well made,
      and the tip of her chin was of a most promising cast for the rest of the
      face; but, Heaven save you! she came upon business! and for a lawyer to
      fall in love with a pretty client on a single consultation, would be as
      wise as if he became enamoured of a particularly bright sunbeam which
      chanced for a moment to gild his bar-wig. I give you my word I am
      heart-whole and moreover, I assure you, that before I suffer a woman to
      sit near my heart&rsquo;s core, I must see her full face, without mask or
      mantle, aye, and know a good deal of her mind into the bargain. So never
      fret yourself on my account, my kind and generous Darsie; but, for your
      own sake, have a care and let not an idle attachment, so lightly taken up,
      lead you into serious danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this subject I feel so apprehensive, that now when I am decorated with
      the honours of the gown, I should have abandoned my career at the very
      starting to come to you, but for my father having contrived to clog my
      heels with fetters of a professional nature. I will tell you the matter at
      length, for it is comical enough; and why should not you list to my
      juridical adventures, as well as I to those of your fiddling
      knight-errantry?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after dinner, and I was considering how I might best introduce to
      my father the private resolution I had formed to set off for
      Dumfriesshire, or whether I had not better run away at once, and plead my
      excuse by letter, when, assuming the peculiar look with which he
      communicates any of his intentions respecting me, that he suspects may not
      be altogether acceptable, &lsquo;Alan,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;ye now wear a gown&mdash;ye
      have opened shop, as we would say of a more mechanical profession; and,
      doubtless, ye think the floor of the courts is strewed with guineas, and
      that ye have only to stoop down to gather them?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope I am sensible, sir,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;that I have some knowledge and
      practice to acquire, and must stoop for that in the first place.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is well said,&rsquo; answered my father; and, always afraid to give too much
      encouragement, added, &lsquo;Very well said, if it be well acted up to&mdash;Stoop
      to get knowledge and practice is the very word. Ye know very well, Alan,
      that in the other faculty who study the ARS MEDENDI, before the young
      doctor gets to the bedsides of palaces, he must, as they call it, walk the
      hospitals; and cure Lazarus of his sores, before he be admitted to
      prescribe for Dives, when he has gout or indigestion&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am aware, sir, that&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whisht&mdash;do not interrupt the court. Well&mdash;also the chirurgeons
      have a useful practice, by which they put their apprentices and tyrones to
      work; upon senseless dead bodies, to which, as they can do no good, so
      they certainly can do as little harm; while at the same time the tyro, or
      apprentice, gains experience, and becomes fit to whip off a leg or arm
      from a living subject, as cleanly as ye would slice an onion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe I guess your meaning, sir,&rsquo; answered I; &lsquo;and were it not for a
      very particular engagement&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not speak to me of engagements; but whisht&mdash;there is a good lad&mdash;and
      do not interrupt the court.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father, you know, is apt&mdash;be it said with all filial duty&mdash;to
      be a little prolix in his harangues. I had nothing for it but to lean back
      and listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Maybe you think, Alan, because I have, doubtless, the management of some
      actions in dependence, whilk my worthy clients have intrusted me with,
      that I may think of airting them your way INSTANTER; and so setting you up
      in practice, so far as my small business or influence may go; and,
      doubtless, Alan, that is a day whilk I hope may come round. But then,
      before I give, as the proverb hath it, &ldquo;My own fish-guts to my own
      sea-maws,&rdquo; I must, for the sake of my own character, be very sure that my
      sea-maw can pick them to some purpose. What say ye?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am so far,&rsquo; answered I, &lsquo;from wishing to get early into practice, sir,
      that I would willingly bestow a few days&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In further study, ye would say, Alan. But that is not the way either&mdash;ye
      must walk the hospitals&mdash;ye must cure Lazarus&mdash;ye must cut and
      carve on a departed subject, to show your skill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sure,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;I will undertake the cause of any poor man with
      pleasure, and bestow as much pains upon it as if it were a duke&rsquo;s; but for
      the next two or three days&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They must be devoted to close study, Alan&mdash;very close study indeed;
      for ye must stand primed for a hearing, IN PRESENTIA DOMINORUM, upon
      Tuesday next.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I, sir?&rsquo; I replied in astonishment&mdash;&lsquo;I have not opened my mouth in
      the Outer House yet!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind the court of the Gentiles, man,&rsquo; said my father; &lsquo;we will have
      you into the Sanctuary at once&mdash;over shoes, over boots.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, sir, I should really spoil any cause thrust on me so hastily.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ye cannot spoil it, Alan,&rsquo; said my father, rubbing his hands with much
      complacency; &lsquo;that is the very cream of the business, man&mdash;it is
      just, as I said before, a subject upon whilk all the TYRONES have been
      trying their whittles for fifteen years; and as there have been about ten
      or a dozen agents concerned, and each took his own way, the case is come
      to that pass, that Stair or Amiston could not mend it; and I do not think
      even you, Alan, can do it much harm&mdash;ye may get credit by it, but ye
      can lose none.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And pray what is the name of my happy client, sir?&rsquo; said I, ungraciously
      enough, I believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is a well-known name in the Parliament House,&rsquo; replied my father. &lsquo;To
      say the truth, I expect him every moment; it is Peter Peebles.&rsquo; [See Note
      4.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Peter Peebles!&rsquo; exclaimed I, in astonishment; &lsquo;he is an insane beggar&mdash;as
      poor as Job, and as mad as a March hare!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has been pleaing in the court for fifteen years,&rsquo; said my father, in a
      tone of commiseration, which seemed to acknowledge that this fact was
      enough to account for the poor man&rsquo;s condition both in mind and
      circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Besides, sir,&rsquo; I added, &lsquo;he is on the Poor&rsquo;s Roll; and you know there are
      advocates regularly appointed to manage those cases; and for me to presume
      to interfere&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whisht, Alan!&mdash;never interrupt the court&mdash;all THAT is managed
      for ye like a tee&rsquo;d ball&rsquo; (my father sometimes draws his similes from his
      once favourite game of golf); &lsquo;you must know, Alan, that Peter&rsquo;s cause was
      to have been opened by young Dumtoustie&mdash;ye may ken the lad, a son of
      Dumtoustie of that ilk, member of Parliament for the county of&mdash;, and
      a nephew of the laird&rsquo;s younger brother, worthy Lord Bladderskate, whilk
      ye are aware sounds as like being akin to a peatship [Formerly, a lawyer,
      supposed to be under the peculiar patronage of any particular judge, was
      invidiously termed his PEAT or PET.] and a sheriffdom, as a sieve is sib
      to a riddle. Now, Peter Drudgeit, my lord&rsquo;s clerk, came to me this morning
      in the House, like ane bereft of his wits; for it seems that young
      Dumtoustie is ane of the Poor&rsquo;s lawyers, and Peter Peebles&rsquo;s process had
      been remitted to him of course. But so soon as the harebrained goose saw
      the pokes [Process-bags.] (as indeed, Alan, they are none of the least) he
      took fright, called for his nag, lap on, and away to the country is he
      gone; and so? said Peter, my lord is at his wit&rsquo;s end wi&rsquo; vexation, and
      shame, to see his nevoy break off the course at the very starting. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      tell you, Peter,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;were I my lord, and a friend or kinsman of mine
      should leave the town while the court was sitting, that kinsman, or be he
      what he liked, should never darken my door again.&rdquo; And then, Alan, I
      thought to turn the ball our own way; and I said that you were a gey sharp
      birkie, just off the irons, and if it would oblige my lord, and so forth,
      you would open Peter&rsquo;s cause on Tuesday, and make some handsome apology
      for the necessary absence of your learned friend, and the loss which your
      client and the court had sustained, and so forth. Peter lap at the
      proposition like a cock at a grossart; for, he said, the only chance was
      to get a new hand, that did not ken the charge he was taking upon him; for
      there was not a lad of two sessions&rsquo; standing that was not dead-sick of
      Peter Peebles and his cause; and he advised me to break the matter gently
      to you at the first; but I told him you were, a good bairn, Alan, and had
      no will and pleasure in these matters but mine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      What could I say, Darsie, in answer to this arrangement, so very well
      meant&mdash;so very vexatious at the same time? To imitate the defection
      and flight of young Dumtoustie, was at once to destroy my father&rsquo;s hopes
      of me for ever; nay, such is the keenness with which he regards all
      connected with his profession, it might have been a step to breaking his
      heart. I was obliged, therefore, to bow in sad acquiescence, when my
      father called to James Wilkinson to bring the two bits of pokes he would
      find on his table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exit James, and presently re-enters, bending under the load of two huge
      leathern bags, full of papers to the brim, and labelled on the greasy
      backs with the magic impress of the clerks of court, and the title,
      PEEBLES AGAINST PLAINSTANES. This huge mass was deposited on the table,
      and my father, with no ordinary glee in his countenance, began to draw
      out; the various bundles of papers, secured by none of your red tape or
      whipcord, but stout, substantial casts of tarred rope, such as might have
      held small craft at their moorings.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made a last and desperate effort to get rid of the impending job. &lsquo;I am
      really afraid, sir, that this case seems so much complicated, and there is
      so little time to prepare, that we had better move the court to supersede
      it till next session.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How, sir?&mdash;how, Alan?&rsquo; said my father&mdash;&lsquo;Would you approbate and
      reprobate, sir? You have accepted the poor man&rsquo;s cause, and if you have
      not his fee in your pocket, it is because he has none to give you; and now
      would you approbate and reprobate in the same breath of your mouth? Think
      of your oath of office, Alan, and your duty to your father, my dear boy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more, what could I say? I saw from my father&rsquo;s hurried and alarmed
      manner, that nothing could vex him so much as failing in the point he had
      determined to carry, and once more intimated my readiness to do my best,
      under every disadvantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well, my boy,&rsquo; said my father, &lsquo;the Lord will make your days long
      in the land, for the honour you have given to your father&rsquo;s grey hairs.
      You may find wiser advisers, Alan, but none that can wish you better.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father, you know, does not usually give way to expressions of
      affection, and they are interesting in proportion to their rarity. My eyes
      began to fill at seeing his glisten; and my delight at having given him
      such sensible gratification would have been unmixed but for the thoughts
      of you. These out of the question, I could have grappled with the bags,
      had they been as large as corn-sacks. But, to turn what was grave into
      farce, the door opened, and Wilkinson ushered in Peter Peebles.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must have seen this original, Darsie, who, like others in the same
      predicament, continues to haunt the courts of justice, where he has made
      shipwreck of time, means, and understanding. Such insane paupers have
      sometimes seemed to me to resemble wrecks lying upon the shoals on the
      Goodwin Sands, or in Yarmouth Roads, warning other vessels to keep aloof
      from the banks on which they have been lost; or rather, such ruined
      clients are like scarecrows and potato-bogies, distributed through the
      courts to scare away fools from the scene of litigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The identical Peter wears a huge greatcoat threadbare and patched itself,
      yet carefully so disposed and secured by what buttons remain, and many
      supplementary pins, as to conceal the still more infirm state of his under
      garments. The shoes and stockings of a ploughman were, however, seen to
      meet at his knees with a pair of brownish, blackish breeches; a
      rusty-coloured handkerchief, that has been black in its day, surrounded
      his throat, and was an apology for linen. His hair, half grey, half black,
      escaped in elf-locks around a huge wig, made of tow, as it seemed to me,
      and so much shrunk that it stood up on the very top of his head; above
      which he plants, when covered, an immense cocked hat, which, like the
      chieftain&rsquo;s banner in an ancient battle, may be seen any sederunt day
      betwixt nine and ten, high towering above all the fluctuating and
      changeful scene in the Outer House, where his eccentricities often make
      him the centre of a group of petulant and teasing boys, who exercise upon
      him every art of ingenious torture. His countenance, originally that of a
      portly, comely burgess, is now emaciated with poverty and anxiety, and
      rendered wild by an insane lightness about the eyes; a withered and
      blighted skin and complexion; features begrimed with snuff, charged with
      the self-importance peculiar to insanity; and a habit of perpetually
      speaking to himself. Such was my unfortunate client; and I must allow,
      Darsie, that my profession had need to do a great deal of good, if, as is
      much to be feared, it brings many individuals to such a pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      After we had been, with a good deal of form, presented to each other, at
      which time I easily saw by my father&rsquo;s manner that he was desirous of
      supporting Peter&rsquo;s character in my eyes, as much as circumstances would
      permit, &lsquo;Alan,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;this is the gentleman who has agreed to accept
      of you as his counsel, in place of young Dumtoustie.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Entirely out of favour to my old acquaintance your father, said Peter.
      with a benign and patronizing countenance, &lsquo;out of respect to your father,
      and my old intimacy with Lord Bladderskate. Otherwise, by the REGIAM
      MAJESTATEM! I would have presented a petition and complaint against Daniel
      Dumtoustie, Advocate, by name and surname&mdash;I would, by all the
      practiques!&mdash;I know the forms of process; and I am not to be triffled
      with.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father here interrupted my client, and reminded him that there was a
      good deal of business to do, as he proposed to give the young counsel an
      outline of the state of the conjoined process, with a view to letting him
      into the merits of the cause, disencumbered from the points of form. &lsquo;I
      have made a short abbreviate, Mr. Peebles,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;having sat up late
      last night, and employed much of this morning in wading through these
      papers, to save Alan some trouble, and I am now about to state the
      result.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will state it myself,&rsquo; said Peter, breaking in without reverence upon
      his solicitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, by no means,&rsquo; said my father; &lsquo;I am your agent for the time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mine eleventh in number,&rsquo; said Peter; &lsquo;I have a new one every year; I
      wish I could get a new coat as regularly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your agent for the time,&rsquo; resumed my father; &lsquo;and you, who are acquainted
      with the forms, know that the client states the cause to the agent&mdash;the
      agent to the counsel&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The counsel to the Lord Ordinary,&rsquo; continued Peter, once set a-going,
      like the peal of an alarm clock, &lsquo;the Ordinary to the Inner House, the
      President to the Bench. It is just like the rope to the man, the man to
      the ox, the ox to the water, the water to the fire&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake, Mr. Peebles,&rsquo; said my father, cutting his
      recitation short; &lsquo;time wears on&mdash;we must get to business&mdash;you
      must not interrupt the court, you know.&mdash;Hem, hem! From this
      abbreviate it appears&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Before you begin,&rsquo; said Peter Peebles &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll thank you to order me a
      morsel of bread and cheese, or some cauld meat, or broth, or the like
      alimentary provision; I was so anxious to see your son, that I could not
      eat a mouthful of dinner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Heartily glad, I believe, to have so good a chance of stopping his
      client&rsquo;s mouth effectually, my father ordered some cold meat; to which
      James Wilkinson, for the honour of the house, was about to add the brandy
      bottle, which remained on the sideboard, but, at a wink from my father,
      supplied its place with small beer. Peter charged the provisions with the
      rapacity of a famished lion; and so well did the diversion engage him,
      that though, while my father stated the case, he looked at him repeatedly,
      as if he meant to interrupt his statement, yet he always found more
      agreeable employment for his mouth, and returned to the cold beef with an
      avidity which convinced me he had not had such an opportunity for many a
      day of satiating his appetite. Omitting much formal phraseology, and many
      legal details, I will endeavour to give you, in exchange for your
      fiddler&rsquo;s tale, the history of a litigant, or rather, the history of his
      lawsuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Peter Peebles and Paul Plainstanes,&rsquo; said my father, entered into
      partnership, in the year&mdash;, as mercers and linendrapers, in the
      Luckenbooths, and carried on a great line of business to mutual advantage.
      But the learned counsel needeth not to be told, SOCIETAS EST MATER
      DISCORDIARUM, partnership oft makes pleaship. The company being dissolved
      by mutual consent, in the year&mdash;, the affairs had to be wound up, and
      after certain attempts to settle the matter extra-judicially, it was at
      last brought into the court, and has branched out into several distinct
      processes, most of whilk have been conjoined by the Ordinary. It is to the
      state of these processes that counsel&rsquo;s attention is particularly
      directed. There is the original action of Peebles v. Plainstanes,
      convening him for payment of 3000l., less or more, as alleged balance due
      by Plainstanes. Secondly, there is a counter action, in which Plainstanes
      is pursuer and Peebles defender, for 2500l., less or more, being balance
      alleged per contra, to be due by Peebles. Thirdly, Mr. Peeble&rsquo;s seventh
      agent advised an action of Compt and Reckoning at his instance, wherein
      what balance should prove due on either side might be fairly struck and
      ascertained. Fourthly, to meet the hypothetical case, that Peebles might
      be found liable in a balance to Plainstanes, Mr. Wildgoose, Mr. Peebles&rsquo;s
      eighth agent, recommended a Multiplepoinding, to bring all parties
      concerned into the field.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My brain was like to turn at this account of lawsuit within lawsuit, like
      a nest of chip-boxes, with all of which I was expected to make myself
      acquainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I understand,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;that Mr. Peebles claims a sum of money from
      Plainstanes&mdash;how then can he be his debtor? and if not his debtor,
      how can he bring a Multiplepoinding, the very summons of which sets forth,
      that the pursuer does owe certain monies, which he is desirous to pay by
      warrant of a judge?&rsquo; [Multiplepoinding is, I believe, equivalent to what
      is called in England a case of Double Distress.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ye know little of the matter, I doubt, friend,&rsquo; said Mr. Peebles; &lsquo;a
      Multiplepoinding is the safest REMEDIUM JURIS in the whole; form of
      process. I have known it conjoined with a declarator of marriage.&mdash;Your
      beef is excellent,&rsquo; he said to my father, who in vain endeavoured to
      resume his legal disquisition; &lsquo;but something highly powdered&mdash;and
      the twopenny is undeniable; but it is small swipes&mdash;small swipes&mdash;more
      of hop than malt-with your leave, I&rsquo;ll try your black bottle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My father started to help him with his own hand, and in due measure; but,
      infinitely to my amusement, Peter got possession of the bottle by the
      neck, and my father&rsquo;s ideas of hospitality were far too scrupulous to
      permit his attempting, by any direct means, to redeem it; so that Peter
      returned to the table triumphant, with his prey in his clutch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Better have a wine-glass, Mr. Peebles,&rsquo; said my father, in an admonitory
      tone, &lsquo;you will find it pretty strong.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If the kirk is ower muckle, we can sing mass in the quire,&rsquo; said Peter,
      helping himself in the goblet out of which he had been drinking the small
      beer. &lsquo;What is it, usquebaugh?&mdash;BRANDY, as I am an honest man! I had
      almost forgotten the name and taste of brandy. Mr. Fairford elder, your
      good health&rsquo; (a mouthful of brandy), &lsquo;Mr. Alan Fairford, wishing you well
      through your arduous undertaking&rsquo; (another go-down of the comfortable
      liquor). &lsquo;And now, though you have given a tolerable breviate of this
      great lawsuit, of whilk everybody has heard something that has walked the
      boards in the Outer House (here&rsquo;s to ye again, by way of interim decreet)
      yet ye have omitted to speak a word of the arrestments.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was just coming to that point, Mr. Peebles.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or of the action of suspension of the charge on the bill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was just coming to that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or the advocation of the Sheriff-Court process.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was just coming to it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As Tweed comes to Melrose, I think,&rsquo; said the litigant; and then filling
      his goblet about a quarter full of brandy, as if in absence of mind, &lsquo;Oh,
      Mr. Alan Fairford, ye are a lucky man to buckle to such a cause as mine at
      the very outset! it is like a specimen of all causes, man. By the Regiam,
      there is not a REMEDIUM JURIS in the practiques but ye&rsquo;ll find a spice
      o&rsquo;t. Here&rsquo;s to your getting weel through with it&mdash;Pshut&mdash;I am
      drinking naked spirits, I think. But if the heathen he ower strong, we&rsquo;ll
      christen him with the brewer&rsquo; (here he added a little small beer to his
      beverage, paused, rolled his eyes, winked, and proceeded),&mdash;&lsquo;Mr.
      Fairford&mdash;the action of assault and battery, Mr. Fairford, when I
      compelled the villain Plainstanes to pull my nose within two steps of King
      Charles&rsquo;s statue, in the Parliament Close&mdash;there I had him in a
      hose-net. Never man could tell me how to shape that process&mdash;no
      counsel that ever selled mind could condescend and say whether it were
      best to proceed by way of petition and complaint, AD VINDICTAM PUBLICAM,
      with consent of his Majesty&rsquo;s advocate, or by action on the statute for
      battery PENDENTE LITE, whilk would be the winning my plea at once, and so
      getting a back-door out of court.&mdash;By the Regiam, that beef and
      brandy is unco het at my heart&mdash;I maun try the ale again&rsquo; (sipped a
      little beer); &lsquo;and the ale&rsquo;s but cauld, I maun e&rsquo;en put in the rest of the
      brandy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was as good as his word, and proceeded in so loud and animated a style
      of elocution, thumping the table, drinking and snuffing alternately, that
      my father, abandoning all attempts to interrupt him, sat silent and
      ashamed, suffering, and anxious for the conclusion of the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And then to come back to my pet process of all&mdash;my battery and
      assault process, when I had the good luck to provoke him to pull my nose
      at the very threshold of the court, whilk was the very thing I wanted&mdash;Mr.
      Pest, ye ken him, Daddie Fairford? Old Pest was for making it out
      HAMESUCKEN, for he said the court might be said&mdash;said&mdash;ugh!&mdash;to
      be my dwelling-place. I dwell mair there than ony gate else, and the
      essence of hamesucken is to strike a man in his dwelling-place&mdash;mind
      that, young advocate&mdash;and so there&rsquo;s hope Plainstanes may be hanged,
      as many has for a less matter; for, my lords,&mdash;will Pest say to the
      Justiciary bodies,&mdash;my lords, the Parliament House is Peebles&rsquo; place
      of dwelling, says he&mdash;being COMMUNE FORUM, and COMMUNE FORUM EST
      COMMUNE DOMICILIUM&mdash;Lass, fetch another glass of and score it&mdash;time
      to gae hame&mdash;by the practiques, I cannot find the jug&mdash;yet
      there&rsquo;s twa of them, I think. By the Regiam, Fairford&mdash;Daddie
      Fairford&mdash;lend us twal pennies to buy sneeshing, mine is done&mdash;Macer,
      call another cause.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The box fell from his hands, and his body would at the same time have
      fallen from the chair, had not I supported him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is intolerable,&rsquo; said my father&mdash;&lsquo;Call a chairman, James
      Wilkinson, to carry this degraded, worthless, drunken beast home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When Peter Peebles was removed from this memorable consultation, under the
      care of an able-bodied Celt, my father hastily bundled up the papers, as a
      showman, whose exhibition has miscarried, hastes to remove his booth.
      &lsquo;Here are my memoranda, Alan,&rsquo; he said, in a hurried way; &lsquo;look them
      carefully over&mdash;compare them with the processes, and turn it in your
      head before Tuesday. Many a good speech has been made for a beast of a
      client; and hark ye, lad, hark ye&mdash;I never intended to cheat you of
      your fee when all was done, though I would have liked to have heard the
      speech first; but there is nothing like corning the horse before the
      journey. Here are five goud guineas in a silk purse&mdash;of your poor
      mother&rsquo;s netting, Alan&mdash;she would have been a blithe woman to have
      seen her young son with a gown on his back&mdash;but no more of that&mdash;be
      a good boy, and to the work like a tiger.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I did set to work, Darsie; for who could resist such motives? With my
      father&rsquo;s assistance, I have mastered the details, confused as they are;
      and on Tuesday I shall plead as well for Peter Peebles as I could for a
      duke. Indeed, I feel my head so clear on the subject as to be able to
      write this long letter to you; into which, however, Peter and his lawsuit
      have insinuated themselves so far as to show you how much they at present
      occupy my thoughts. Once more, be careful of yourself, and mindful of me,
      who am ever thine, while ALAN FAIRFORD.
    </p>
    <p>
      From circumstances, to be hereafter mentioned, it was long ere this letter
      reached the person to whom it was addressed.

      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <h3>
      NARRATIVE
    </h3>
    <p>
      The advantage of laying before the reader, in the words of the actors
      themselves, the adventures which we must otherwise have narrated in our
      own, has given great popularity to the publication of epistolary
      correspondence, as practised by various great authors, and by ourselves in
      the preceding chapters. Nevertheless, a genuine correspondence of this
      kind (and Heaven forbid it should be in any respect sophisticated by
      interpolations of our own!) can seldom be found to contain all in which it
      is necessary to instruct the reader for his full comprehension of the
      story. Also it must often happen that various prolixities and redundancies
      occur in the course of an interchange of letters, which must hang as a
      dead weight on the progress of the narrative. To avoid this dilemma, some
      biographers have used the letters of the personages concerned, or liberal
      extracts from them, to describe particular incidents, or express the
      sentiments which they entertained; while they connect them occasionally
      with such portions of narrative, as may serve to carry on the thread of
      the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is thus that the adventurous travellers who explore the summit of Mont
      Blanc now move on through the crumbling snowdrift so slowly, that their
      progress is almost imperceptible, and anon abridge their journey by
      springing over the intervening chasms which cross their path, with the
      assistance of their pilgrim-staves. Or, to make a briefer simile, the
      course of story-telling which we have for the present adopted, resembles
      the original discipline of the dragoons, who were trained to serve either
      on foot or horseback, as the emergencies of the service required. With
      this explanation, we shall proceed to narrate some circumstances which
      Alan Fairford did not, and could not, write to his correspondent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our reader, we trust, has formed somewhat approaching to a distinct idea
      of the principal characters who have appeared before him during our
      narrative; but in case our good opinion of his sagacity has been
      exaggerated, and in order to satisfy such as are addicted to the laudable
      practice of SKIPPING (with whom we have at times a strong fellow-feeling),
      the following particulars may not be superfluous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Saunders Fairford, as he was usually called, was a man of business of
      the old school, moderate in his charges, economical and even niggardly in
      his expenditure, strictly honest in conducting his own affairs and those
      of his clients, but taught by long experience to be wary and suspicious in
      observing the motions of others. Punctual as the clock of Saint Giles
      tolled nine, the neat dapper form of the little hale old gentleman was
      seen at the threshold of the court hall, or at farthest, at the head of
      the Back Stairs, trimly dressed in a complete suit of snuff-coloured
      brown, with stockings of silk or woollen as, suited the weather; a
      bob-wig, and a small cocked hat; shoes blacked as Warren would have
      blacked them; silver shoe-buckles, and a gold stock-buckle. A nosegay in
      summer, and a sprig of holly in winter, completed his well-known dress and
      appearance. His manners corresponded with his attire, for they were
      scrupulously civil, and not a little formal. He was an elder of the kirk,
      and, of course, zealous for King George and the Government even to
      slaying, as he had showed by taking up arms in their cause. But then, as
      he had clients and connexions of business among families of opposite
      political tenets, he was particularly cautious to use all the conventional
      phrases which the civility of the time had devised, as an admissible mode
      of language betwixt the two parties. Thus he spoke sometimes of the
      Chevalier, but never either of the Prince, which would have been
      sacrificing his own principles, or of the Pretender, which would have been
      offensive to those of others. Again, he usually designated the Rebellion
      as the AFFAIR of 1745, and spoke of any one engaged in it as a person who
      had been OUT at a certain period. [OLD-FASHIONED SCOTTISH CIVILITY.&mdash;Such
      were literally the points of politeness observed in general society during
      the author&rsquo;s youth, where it was by no means unusual in a company
      assembled by chance, to find individuals who had borne arms on one side or
      other in the civil broils of 1745. Nothing, according to my recollection,
      could be more gentle and decorous than the respect these old enemies paid
      to each other&rsquo;s prejudices. But in this I speak generally. I have
      witnessed one or two explosions.] So that, on the whole, Mr. Fairford was
      a man much liked and respected on all sides, though his friends would not
      have been sorry if he had given a dinner more frequently, as his little
      cellar contained some choice old wine, of which, on such rare occasions he
      was no niggard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole pleasure of this good old-fashioned man of method, besides that
      which he really felt in the discharge of his daily business, was the hope
      to see his son Alan, the only fruit of a union which death early
      dissolved, attain what in the father&rsquo;s eyes was the proudest of all
      distinctions&mdash;the rank and fame of a well-employed lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every profession has its peculiar honours, and Mr. Fairford&rsquo;s mind was
      constructed upon so limited and exclusive a plan, that he valued nothing
      save the objects of ambition which his own presented. He would have
      shuddered at Alan&rsquo;s acquiring the renown of a hero, and laughed with scorn
      at the equally barren laurels of literature; it was by the path of the law
      alone that he was desirous to see him rise to eminence, and the
      probabilities of success or disappointment were the thoughts of his father
      by day, and his dream by night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The disposition of Alan Fairford, as well as his talents, were such as to
      encourage his father&rsquo;s expectations. He had acuteness of intellect, joined
      to habits of long and patient study, improved no doubt by the discipline
      of his father&rsquo;s house; to which, generally speaking, he conformed with the
      utmost docility, expressing no wish for greater or more frequent
      relaxation than consisted with his father&rsquo;s anxious and severe
      restrictions. When he did indulge in any juvenile frolics, his father had
      the candour to lay the whole blame upon his more mercurial companion,
      Darsie Latimer.
    </p>
    <p>
      This youth, as the reader must be aware, had been received as an inmate
      into the family of Mr. Fairford, senior, at a time when some of the
      delicacy of constitution which had abridged the life of his consort began
      to show itself in the son, and when the father was, of course, peculiarly
      disposed to indulge his slightest wish. That the young Englishman was able
      to pay a considerable board, was a matter of no importance to Mr.
      Fairford; it was enough that his presence seemed to make his son cheerful
      and happy. He was compelled to allow that &lsquo;Darsie was a fine lad, though
      unsettled,&rsquo; and he would have had some difficulty in getting rid of him,
      and the apprehensions which his levities excited, had it not been for the
      voluntary excursion which gave rise to the preceding correspondence, and
      in which Mr. Fairford secretly rejoiced, as affording the means of
      separating Alan from his gay companion, at least until he should have
      assumed, and become accustomed to, the duties of his dry and laborious
      profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the absence of Darsie was far from promoting the end which the elder
      Mr. Fairford had expected and desired. The young men were united by the
      closest bonds of intimacy; and the more so, that neither of them sought
      nor desired to admit any others into their society. Alan Fairford was
      averse to general company, from a disposition naturally reserved, and
      Darsie Latimer from a painful sense of his own unknown origin, peculiarly
      afflicting in a country where high and low are professed genealogists. The
      young men were all in all to each other; it is no wonder, therefore, that
      their separation was painful, and that its effects upon Alan Fairford,
      joined to the anxiety occasioned by the tenor of his friend&rsquo;s letters,
      greatly exceeded what the senior had anticipated. The young man went
      through his usual duties, his studies, and the examinations to which he
      was subjected, but with nothing like the zeal and assiduity which he had
      formerly displayed; and his anxious and observant father saw but too
      plainly that his heart was with his absent comrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      A philosopher would have given way to this tide of feeling, in hopes to
      have diminished its excess, and permitted the youths to have been some
      time together, that their intimacy might have been broken off by degrees;
      but Mr. Fairford only saw the more direct mode of continued restraint,
      which, however, he was desirous of veiling under some plausible pretext.
      In the anxiety which he felt on this occasion, he had held communication
      with an old acquaintance, Peter Drudgeit, with whom the reader is partly
      acquainted. &lsquo;Alan,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;was ance wud, and ay waur; and he was
      expecting every moment when he would start off in a wildgoose-chase after
      the callant Latimer; Will Sampson, the horse-hirer in Candlemaker Row, had
      given him a hint that Alan had been looking for a good hack, to go to the
      country for a few days. And then to oppose him downright&mdash;he could
      not but think on the way his poor mother was removed. Would to Heaven he
      was yoked to some tight piece of business, no matter whether well or ill
      paid, but some job that would hamshackle him at least until the courts
      rose, if it were but for decency&rsquo;s sake.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Drudgeit sympathized, for Peter had a son, who, reason or none,
      would needs exchange the torn and inky fustian sleeves for the blue jacket
      and white lapelle; and he suggested, as the reader knows, the engaging our
      friend Alan in the matter of Poor Peter Peebles, just opened by the
      desertion of young Dumtoustie, whose defection would be at the same time
      concealed; and this, Drudgeit said, &lsquo;would be felling two dogs with one
      stone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these explanations, the reader will hold a man of the elder
      Fairford&rsquo;s sense and experience free from the hazardous and impatient
      curiosity with which boys fling a puppy into a deep pond, merely to see if
      the creature can swim. However confident in his son&rsquo;s talents, which were
      really considerable, he would have been very sorry to have involved him in
      the duty of pleading a complicated and difficult case, upon his very first
      appearance at the bar, had he not resorted to it as an effectual way to
      prevent the young man from taking a step which his habits of thinking
      represented as a most fatal one at his outset of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betwixt two evils, Mr. Fairford chose that which was in his own
      apprehension the least; and, like a brave officer sending forth his son to
      battle, rather chose he should die upon the breach, than desert the
      conflict with dishonour. Neither did he leave him to his own unassisted
      energies. Like Alpheus preceding Hercules, he himself encountered the
      Augean mass of Peter Peebles&rsquo; law-matters. It was to the old man a labour
      of love to place in a clear and undistorted view the real merits of this
      case, which the carelessness and blunders of Peter&rsquo;s former solicitors had
      converted into a huge chaotic mass of unintelligible technicality; and
      such was his skill and industry, that he was able, after the severe toil
      of two or three days, to present to the consideration of the young counsel
      the principal facts of the case, in a light equally simple and
      comprehensible. With the assistance of a solicitor so affectionate and
      indefatigable, Alan Fairford was enabled, then the day of trial arrived,
      to walk towards the court, attended by his anxious yet encouraging parent,
      with some degree of confidence that he would lose no reputation upon this
      arduous occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were met at the door of the court by Poor Peter Peebles in his usual
      plenitude of wig and celsitude of hat. He seized on the young pleader like
      a lion on his prey. &lsquo;How is a&rsquo; wi&rsquo; you, Mr. Alan&mdash;how is a&rsquo; wi&rsquo; you,
      man? The awfu&rsquo; day is come at last&mdash;a day that will be lang minded in
      this house. Poor Peter Peebles against Plainstanes&mdash;conjoined
      proceases&mdash;Hearing in presence&mdash;stands for the Short Roll for
      this day&mdash;I have not been able to sleep for a week for thinking of
      it, and, I dare to say, neither has the Lord President himsell&mdash;for
      such a cause!! But your father garr&rsquo;d me tak a wee drap ower muckle of his
      pint bottle the other night; it&rsquo;s no right to mix brandy wi&rsquo; business, Mr.
      Fairford. I would have been the waur o&rsquo; liquor if I would have drank as
      muckle as you twa would have had me. But there&rsquo;s a time for a&rsquo; things, and
      if ye will dine with me after the case is heard, or whilk is the same, or
      maybe better, I&rsquo;LL gang my ways hame wi&rsquo; YOU, and I winna object to a
      cheerfu&rsquo; glass, within the bounds of moderation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Fairford shrugged his shoulders and hurried past the client, saw his
      son wrapped in the sable bombazine, which, in his eyes, was more venerable
      than an archbishop&rsquo;s lawn, and could not help fondly patting his shoulder,
      and whispering to him to take courage, and show he was worthy to wear it.
      The party entered the Outer Hall of the court, (once the place of meeting
      of the ancient Scottish Parliament), and which corresponds to the use of
      Westminster Hall in England, serving as a vestibule to the Inner House, as
      it is termed, and a place of dominion to certain sedentary personages
      called Lords Ordinary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The earlier part of the morning was spent by old Fairford in reiterating
      his instructions to Alan, and in running from one person to another, from
      whom he thought he could still glean some grains of information, either
      concerning the point at issue, or collateral cases. Meantime, Poor Peter
      Peebles, whose shallow brain was altogether unable to bear the importance
      of the moment, kept as close to his young counsel as shadow to substance,
      affected now to speak loud, now to whisper in his ear, now to deck his
      ghastly countenance with wreathed smiles, now to cloud it with a shade of
      deep and solemn importance, and anon to contort it with the sneer of scorn
      and derision. These moods of the client&rsquo;s mind were accompanied with
      singular &lsquo;mockings and mowings,&rsquo; fantastic gestures, which the man of rags
      and litigation deemed appropriate to his changes of countenance. Now he
      brandished his arm aloft, now thrust his fist straight out, as if to knock
      his opponent down. Now he laid his open palm on his bosom, and now hinging
      it abroad, he gallantly snapped his fingers in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      These demonstrations, and the obvious shame and embarrassment of Alan
      Fairford, did not escape the observation of the juvenile idlers in the
      hall. They did not, indeed, approach Peter with their usual familiarity,
      from some feeling of deference towards Fairford, though many accused him
      of conceit in presuming to undertake, at this early stage of his practice,
      a case of considerable difficulty. But Alan, notwithstanding this
      forbearance, was not the less sensible that he and his companion were the
      subjects of many a passing jest, and many a shout of laughter, with which
      that region at all times abounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the young counsel&rsquo;s patience gave way, and as it threatened to
      carry his presence of mind and recollection along with it, Alan frankly
      told his father, that unless he was relieved from the infliction of his
      client&rsquo;s personal presence and instructions, he must necessarily throw up
      his brief, and decline pleading the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush, hush, my dear Alan,&rsquo; said the old gentleman, almost at his own
      wit&rsquo;s end upon hearing this dilemma; &lsquo;dinna mind the silly ne&rsquo;er-do-weel;
      we cannot keep the man from hearing his own cause, though he be not quite
      right in the head.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On my life, sir,&rsquo; answered Alan, &lsquo;I shall be unable to go on, he drives
      everything out of my remembrance; and if I attempt to speak seriously of
      the injuries he has sustained, and the condition he is reduced to, how can
      I expect but that the very appearance of such an absurd scarecrow will
      turn it all into ridicule?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is something in that,&rsquo; said Saunders Fairford, glancing a look at
      Poor Peter, and then cautiously inserting his forefinger under his
      bob-wig, in order to rub his temple and aid his invention; &lsquo;he is no
      figure for the fore-bar to see without laughing; but how to get rid of
      him? To speak sense, or anything like it, is the last thing he will listen
      to. Stay, aye,&mdash;Alan, my darling, hae patience; I&rsquo;ll get him off on
      the instant, like a gowff ba&rsquo;.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he hastened to his ally, Peter Drudgeit, who on seeing him with
      marks of haste in his gait, and care upon his countenance, clapped his pen
      behind his ear, with &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the stir now, Mr. Saunders? Is there aught
      wrang?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a dollar, man,&rsquo; said Mr. Saunders; &lsquo;now, or never, Peter, do me a
      good turn. Yonder&rsquo;s your namesake, Peter Peebles, will drive the swine
      through our bonny hanks of yarn; get him over to John&rsquo;s Coffeehouse, man&mdash;gie
      him his meridian&mdash;keep him there, drunk or sober, till the hearing is
      ower.&rsquo; [The simile is obvious, from the old manufacture of Scotland, when
      the gudewife&rsquo;s thrift, as the yarn wrought in the winter was called, when
      laid down to bleach by the burn-side, was peculiarly exposed to the
      inroads of pigs, seldom well regulated about a Scottish farm-house.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eneugh said,&rsquo; quoth Peter Drudgeit, no way displeased with his own share
      in the service required, &lsquo;We&rsquo;se do your bidding.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, the scribe was presently seen whispering in the ear of Peter
      Peebles, whose response came forth in the following broken form:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Leave the court for ae minute on this great day of judgement? not I, by
      the Reg&mdash;Eh! what? Brandy, did ye say&mdash;French brandy?&mdash;couldna
      ye fetch a stoup to the bar under your coat, man? Impossible? Nay, if it&rsquo;s
      clean impossible, and if we have an hour good till they get through the
      single bill and the summar-roll, I carena if I cross the close wi&rsquo; you; I
      am sure I need something to keep my heart up this awful day; but I&rsquo;ll no
      stay above an instant&mdash;not above a minute of time&mdash;nor drink
      aboon a single gill,&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes afterwards, the two Peters were seen moving through the
      Parliament Close (which new-fangled affectation has termed a Square), the
      triumphant Drudgeit leading captive the passive Peebles, whose legs
      conducted him towards the dramshop, while his reverted eyes were fixed
      upon the court. They dived into the Cimmerian abysses of John&rsquo;s
      Coffeehouse, [See Note 5.] formerly the favourite rendezvous of the
      classical and genial Doctor Pitcairn, and were for the present seen no
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Relieved from his tormentor, Alan Fairford had time to rally his
      recollections, which, in the irritation of his spirits, had nearly escaped
      him, and to prepare himself far a task, the successful discharge or
      failure in which must, he was aware, have the deepest influence upon his
      fortunes. He had pride, was not without a consciousness of talent, and the
      sense of his father&rsquo;s feelings upon the subject impelled him to the utmost
      exertion. Above all, he had that sort of self-command which is essential
      to success in every arduous undertaking, and he was constitutionally free
      from that feverish irritability by which those whose over-active
      imaginations exaggerate difficulties, render themselves incapable of
      encountering such when they arrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having collected all the scattered and broken associations which were
      necessary, Alan&rsquo;s thoughts reverted to Dumfriesshire, and the precarious
      situation in which he feared his beloved friend had placed himself; and
      once and again he consulted his watch, eager to have his present task
      commenced and ended, that he might hasten to Darsie&rsquo;s assistance. The hour
      and moment at length arrived. The macer shouted, with all his
      well-remembered brazen strength of lungs, &lsquo;Poor Peter Peebles VERSUS
      Plainstanes, PER Dumtoustie ET Tough!&mdash;Maister Da-a-niel Dumtoustie!&rsquo; 
      Dumtoustie answered not the summons, which, deep and swelling as it was,
      could not reach across the Queensferry; but our Maister Alan Fairford
      appeared in his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The court was very much crowded; for much amusement had been received on
      former occasions when Peter had volunteered his own oratory, and had been
      completely successful in routing the gravity of the whole procedure, and
      putting to silence, not indeed the counsel of the opposite party, but his
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both bench and audience seemed considerably surprised at the juvenile
      appearance of the young man who appeared in the room of Dumtoustie, for
      the purpose of opening this complicated and long depending process, and
      the common herd were disappointed at the absence of Peter the client, the
      Punchinello of the expected entertainment. The judges looked with a very
      favourable countenance on our friend Alan, most of them being acquainted,
      more or less, with so old a practitioner as his father, and all, or almost
      all, affording, from civility, the same fair play to the first pleading of
      a counsel, which the House of Commons yields to the maiden speech of one
      of its members.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Bladderskate was an exception to this general expression of
      benevolence. He scowled upon Alan, from beneath his large, shaggy, grey
      eyebrows, just as if the young lawyer had been usurping his nephew&rsquo;s
      honours, instead of covering his disgrace; and, from feelings which did
      his lordship little honour, he privately hoped the young man would not
      succeed in the cause which his kinsman had abandoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Lord Bladderskate, however, was, in spite of himself, pleased with
      the judicious and modest tone in which Alan began his address to the
      court, apologizing for his own presumption, and excusing it by the sudden
      illness of his learned brother, for whom the labour of opening a cause of
      some difficulty and importance had been much more worthily designed. He
      spoke of himself as he really was, and of young Dumtoustie as what he
      ought to have been, taking care not to dwell on either topic a moment
      longer than was necessary. The old judge&rsquo;s looks became benign; his family
      pride was propitiated, and, pleased equally with the modesty and civility
      of the young man whom he had thought forward and officious, he relaxed the
      scorn of his features into an expression of profound attention; the
      highest compliment, and the greatest encouragement, which a judge can
      render to the counsel addressing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having succeeded in securing the favourable attention of the court, the
      young lawyer, using the lights which his father&rsquo;s experience and knowledge
      of business had afforded him, proceeded with an address and clearness,
      unexpected from one of his years, to remove from the case itself those
      complicated formalities with which it had been loaded, as a surgeon strips
      from a wound the dressings which had been hastily wrapped round it, in
      order to proceed to his cure SECUNDUM ARTEM. Developed of the cumbrous and
      complicated technicalities of litigation, with which the perverse
      obstinacy of the client, the inconsiderate haste or ignorance of his
      agents, and the evasions of a subtle adversary, had invested the process,
      the cause of Poor Peter Peebles, standing upon its simple merits, was no
      bad subject for the declamation of a young counsel, nor did our friend
      Alan fail to avail himself of its strong points.
    </p>
    <p>
      He exhibited his client as a simple-hearted, honest, well-meaning man,
      who, during a copartnership of twelve years, had gradually become
      impoverished, while his partner (his former clerk) having no funds but his
      share of the same business, into which he had been admitted without any
      advance of stock, had become gradually more and more wealthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Their association,&rsquo; said Alan, and the little flight was received with
      some applause, &lsquo;resembled the ancient story of the fruit which was carved
      with a knife poisoned on one side of the blade only, so that the
      individual to whom the envenomed portion was served, drew decay and death
      from what afforded savour and sustenance to the consumer of the other
      moiety.&rsquo; He then plunged boldly into the MARE MAGNUM of accompts between
      the parties; he pursued each false statement from the waste-book to the
      day-book, from the day-book to the bill-book, from the bill-book to the
      ledger; placed the artful interpolations and insertions of the fallacious
      Plainstanes in array against each other, and against the fact; and
      availing himself to the utmost of his father&rsquo;s previous labours, and his
      own knowledge of accompts, in which he had been sedulously trained, he
      laid before the court a clear and intelligible statement of the affairs of
      the copartnery, showing, with precision, that a large balance must, at the
      dissolution, have been due to his client, sufficient to have enabled him
      to have carried on business on his own account, and thus to have retained
      his situation in society as an independent and industrious tradesman. &lsquo;But
      instead of this justice being voluntarily rendered by the former clerk to
      his former master,&mdash;by the party obliged to his benefactor,&mdash;by
      one honest man to another,&mdash;his wretched client had been compelled to
      follow his quondam clerk, his present debtor, from court to court; had
      found his just claims met with well-invented but unfounded counter-claims,
      had seen his party shift his character of pursuer or defender, as often as
      Harlequin effects his transformations, till, in a chase so varied and so
      long, the unhappy litigant had lost substance, reputation, and almost the
      use of reason itself, and came before their lordships an object of
      thoughtless derision to the unreflecting, of compassion to the
      better-hearted, and of awful meditation to every one who considered that,
      in a country where excellent laws were administered by upright and
      incorruptible judges, a man might pursue an almost indisputable claim
      through all the mazes of litigation; lose fortune, reputation, and reason
      itself in the chase, and now come before the supreme court of his country
      in the wretched condition of his unhappy client, a victim to protracted
      justice, and to that hope delayed which sickens the heart.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The force of this appeal to feeling made as much impression on the Bench
      as had been previously effected by the clearness of Alan&rsquo;s argument. The
      absurd form of Peter himself, with his tow-wig, was fortunately not
      present to excite any ludicrous emotion, and the pause that took place
      when the young lawyer had concluded his speech, was followed by a murmur
      of approbation, which the ears of his father drank in as the sweetest
      sounds that had ever entered them. Many a hand of gratulation was thrust
      out to his grasp, trembling as it was with anxiety, and finally with
      delight; his voice faltering as he replied, &lsquo;Aye, aye, I kend Alan was the
      lad to make a spoon or spoil a horn.&rsquo; [Said of an adventurous gipsy, who
      resolves at all risks to convert a sheep&rsquo;s horn into a spoon.]
    </p>
    <p>
      The counsel on the other side arose, an old practitioner, who had noted
      too closely the impression made by Alan&rsquo;s pleading not to fear the
      consequences of an immediate decision. He paid the highest compliments to
      his very young brother&mdash;&lsquo;the Benjamin, as he would presume to call
      him, of the learned Faculty&mdash;said the alleged hardships of Mr.
      Peebles were compensated by his being placed in a situation where the
      benevolence of their lordships had assigned him gratuitously such
      assistance as he might not otherwise have obtained at a high price&mdash;and
      allowed his young brother had put many things in such a new point of view,
      that, although he was quite certain of his ability to refute them, he was
      honestly desirous of having a few hours to arrange his answer, in order to
      be able to follow Mr. Fairford from point to point. He had further to
      observe, there was one point of the case to which his brother, whose
      attention had been otherwise so wonderfully comprehensive, had not given
      the consideration which he expected; it was founded on the interpretation
      of certain correspondence which had passed betwixt the parties soon after
      the dissolution of the copartnery.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The court having heard Mr. Tough, readily allowed him two days for
      preparing himself, hinting at the same time that he might find his task
      difficult, and affording the young counsel, with high encomiums upon the
      mode in which he had acquitted himself, the choice of speaking, either now
      or at the next calling of the cause, upon the point which Plainstanes&rsquo;s
      lawyer had adverted to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan modestly apologized for what in fact had been an omission very
      pardonable in so complicated a case, and professed himself instantly ready
      to go through that correspondence, and prove that it was in form and
      substance exactly applicable to the view of the case he had submitted to
      their lordships. He applied to his father, who sat behind him, to hand
      him, from time to time, the letters, in the order in which he meant to
      read and comment upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Counsellor Tough had probably formed an ingenious enough scheme to
      blunt the effect of the young lawyer&rsquo;s reasoning, by thus obliging him to
      follow up a process of reasoning, clear and complete in itself, by a hasty
      and extemporary appendix. If so, he seemed likely to be disappointed; for
      Alan was well prepared on this as on other parts of the cause, and
      recommenced his pleading with a degree of animation which added force even
      to what he had formerly stated, and might perhaps have occasioned the old
      gentleman to regret his having again called him up, when his father, as he
      handed him the letters, put one into his hand which produced a singular
      effect on the pleader.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first glance, he saw that the paper had no reference to the affairs
      of Peter Peebles; but the first glance also showed him, what, even at that
      time, and in that presence, he could not help reading; and which, being
      read, seemed totally to disconcert his ideas. He stopped short in his
      harangue&mdash;gazed on the paper with a look of surprise and
      horror-uttered an exclamation, and flinging down the brief which he had in
      his hand, hurried out of court without returning a single word of answer
      to the various questions, &lsquo;What was the matter?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Was he taken
      unwell?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Should not a chair be called?&rsquo; &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder Mr. Fairford, who remained seated, and looking as senseless as
      if he had been made of stone, was at length recalled to himself by the
      anxious inquiries of the judges and the counsel after his son&rsquo;s health. He
      then rose with an air, in which was mingled the deep habitual reverence in
      which he held the court, with some internal cause of agitation, and with
      difficulty mentioned something of a mistake&mdash;a piece of bad news&mdash;Alan,
      he hoped would be well enough to-morrow. But unable to proceed further, he
      clasped his hands together, exclaiming, &lsquo;My son! my son!&rsquo; and left the
      court hastily, as if in pursuit of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with the auld bitch next?&rsquo; [Tradition ascribes this
      whimsical style of language to the ingenious and philosophical Lord
      Kaimes.] said an acute metaphysical judge, though somewhat coarse in his
      manners, aside to his brethren. &lsquo;This is a daft cause, Bladderskate&mdash;first,
      it drives the poor man mad that aught it&mdash;then your nevoy goes daft
      with fright, and flies the pit&mdash;then this smart young hopeful is aff
      the hooks with too hard study, I fancy&mdash;and now auld Saunders
      Fairford is as lunatic as the best of them. What say ye till&rsquo;t, ye bitch?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing, my lord,&rsquo; answered Bladderskate, much too formal to admire the
      levities in which his philosophical brother sometimes indulged&mdash;&lsquo;I
      say nothing, but pray to Heaven to keep our own wits.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Amen, amen,&rsquo; answered his learned brother; &lsquo;for some of us have but few
      to spare.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The court then arose, and the audience departed, greatly wondering at the
      talent displayed by Alan Fairford at his first appearance in a case so
      difficult and so complicated, and assigning a hundred conjectural causes,
      each different from the others, for the singular interruption which had
      clouded his day of success. The worst of the whole was, that six agents,
      who had each come to the separate resolution of thrusting a retaining fee
      into Alan&rsquo;s hand as he left the court, shook their heads as they returned
      the money into their leathern pouches, and said, &lsquo;that the lad was clever,
      but they would like to see more of him before they engaged him in the way
      of business&mdash;they did not like his lowping away like a flea in a
      blanket.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Had our friend Alexander Fairford known the consequences of his son&rsquo;s
      abrupt retreat from the court, which are mentioned in the end of the last
      chapter, it might have accomplished the prediction of the lively old
      judge, and driven him utterly distracted. As it was, he was miserable
      enough. His son had risen ten degrees higher in his estimation than ever
      by his display of juridical talents, which seemed to assure him that the
      applause of the judges and professors of the law, which, in his
      estimation, was worth that of all mankind besides, authorized to the
      fullest extent the advantageous estimate which even his parental
      partiality had been induced to form of Alan&rsquo;s powers. On the other hand,
      he felt that he was himself a little humbled, from a disguise which he had
      practised towards this son of his hopes and wishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth was, that on the morning of this eventful day, Mr. Alexander
      Fairford had received from his correspondent and friend, Provost Crosbie
      of Dumfries, a letter of the following tenor:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;DEAR SIR, &lsquo;Your respected favour of 25th ultimo, per favour of Mr. Darsie
      Latimer, reached me in safety, and I showed to the young gentleman such
      attention as he was pleased to accept of. The object of my present writing
      is twofold. First, the council are of opinion that you should now begin to
      stir in the thirlage cause; and they think they will be able, from
      evidence NOVITER REPERTUM, to enable you to amend your condescendence upon
      the use and wont of the burgh, touching the GRANA INVECTA ET ILLATA. So
      you will please consider yourself as authorized to speak to Mr. Pest, and
      lay before him the papers which you will receive by the coach. The council
      think that a fee of two guineas may be sufficient on this occasion, as Mr.
      Pest had three for drawing the original condescendence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I take the opportunity of adding that there has been a great riot among
      the Solway fishermen, who have destroyed, in a masterful manner, the
      stake-nets set up near the mouth of this river; and have besides attacked
      the house of Quaker Geddes, one of the principal partners of the Tide-net
      Fishing Company, and done a great deal of damage. Am sorry to add, young
      Mr. Latimer was in the fray and has not since been heard of. Murder is
      spoke of, but that may be a word of course. As the young gentleman has
      behaved rather oddly while in these parts, as in declining to dine with me
      more than once, and going about the country with strolling fiddlers and
      such-like, I rather hope that his present absence is only occasioned by a
      frolic; but as his servant has been making inquiries of me respecting his
      master, I thought it best to acquaint you in course of post. I have only
      to add that our sheriff has taken a precognition, and committed one or two
      of the rioters. If I can be useful in this matter, either by advertising
      for Mr. Latimer as missing, publishing a reward, or otherwise, I will obey
      your respected instructions, being your most obedient to command, &lsquo;WILLIAM
      CROSBIE.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Fairford received this letter, and had read it to an end,&rsquo; his
      first idea was to communicate it to his son, that an express might be
      instantly dispatched, or a king&rsquo;s messenger sent with proper authority to
      search after his late guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The habits of the fishers were rude; as he well knew, though not
      absolutely sanguinary or ferocious; and there had been instances of their
      transporting persons who had interfered in their smuggling trade to the
      Isle of Man and elsewhere, and keeping them under restraint for many
      weeks. On this account, Mr. Fairford was naturally led to feel anxiety
      concerning the fate of his late inmate; and, at a less interesting moment,
      would certainly have set out himself, or licensed his son to go in pursuit
      of his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, alas! he was both a father and an agent. In the one capacity, he
      looked on his son as dearer to him than all the world besides; in the
      other, the lawsuit which he conducted was to him like an infant to its
      nurse, and the case of Poor Peter Peebles against Plainstanes was, he saw,
      adjourned, perhaps SINE DIE, should this document reach the hands of his
      son. The mutual and enthusiastical affection betwixt the young men was
      well known to him; and he concluded that if the precarious state of
      Latimer were made known to Alan Fairford, it would render him not only
      unwilling, but totally unfit, to discharge the duty of the day to which
      the old gentleman attached such ideas of importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      On mature reflection, therefore, he resolved, though not without some
      feelings of compunction, to delay communicating to his son the
      disagreeable intelligence which he had received, until the business of the
      day should be ended. The delay, he persuaded himself, could be of little
      consequence to Darsie Latimer, whose folly, he dared to say, had led him
      into some scrape which would meet an appropriate punishment in some
      accidental restraint, which would be thus prolonged for only a few hours
      longer. Besides, he would have time to speak to the sheriff of the county&mdash;perhaps
      to the King&rsquo;s Advocate&mdash;and set about the matter in a regular manner,
      or, as he termed it, as summing up the duties of a solicitor, to AGE AS
      ACCORDS. [A Scots law phrase, of no very determinate import, meaning,
      generally, to do what is fitting.]
    </p>
    <p>
      The scheme, as we have seen, was partially successful, and was only
      ultimately defeated, as he confessed to himself with shame, by his own
      very unbusiness-like mistake of shuffling the provost&rsquo;s letter, in the
      hurry and anxiety of the morning, among some papers belonging to Peter
      Peebles&rsquo;s affairs, and then handing it to his son, without observing the
      blunder. He used to protest, even till the day of his death, that he never
      had been guilty of such an inaccuracy as giving a paper out of his hand
      without looking at the docketing, except on that unhappy occasion, when,
      of all others, he had such particular reason to regret his negligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disturbed by these reflections, the old gentleman had, for the first time
      in his life, some disinclination, arising from shame and vexation, to face
      his own son; so that to protract for a little the meeting, which he feared
      would be a painful one, he went to wait upon the sheriff-depute, who he
      found had set off for Dumfries in great haste to superintend in person the
      investigation which had been set on foot by his substitute. This
      gentleman&rsquo;s clerk could say little on the subject of the riot, excepting
      that it had been serious, much damage done to property, and some personal
      violence offered to individuals; but, as far as he had yet heard, no lives
      lost on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fairford was compelled to return home with this intelligence; and on
      inquiring at James Wilkinson where his son was, received for answer, that
      &lsquo;Maister Alan was in his own room, and very busy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We must have our explanation over,&rsquo; said Saunders Fairford to himself.
      &lsquo;Better a finger off, as ay wagging;&rsquo; and going to the door of his son&rsquo;s
      apartment, he knocked at first gently&mdash;then more loudly&mdash;but
      received no answer. Somewhat alarmed at this silence, he opened the door
      of the chamber it was empty&mdash;clothes lay mixed in confusion with the
      law-books and papers, as if the inmate had been engaged in hastily packing
      for a journey. As Mr. Fairford looked around in alarm, his eye was
      arrested by a sealed letter lying upon his son&rsquo;s writing-table, and
      addressed to himself. It contained the following words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;MY DEAREST FATHER, &lsquo;You will not, I trust, be surprised, nor perhaps very
      much displeased, to learn that I am on my way to Dumfriesshire, to learn,
      by my own personal investigation, the present state of my dear friend, and
      afford him such relief as may be in my power, and which, I trust, will be
      effectual. I do not presume to reflect upon you, dearest sir, for
      concealing from me information of so much consequence to my peace of mind
      and happiness; but I hope your having done so will be, if not an excuse,
      at least some mitigation of my present offence, in taking a step of
      consequence without consulting your pleasure; and, I must further own,
      under circumstances which perhaps might lead to your disapprobation of my
      purpose. I can only say, in further apology, that if anything unhappy,
      which Heaven forbid! shall have occurred to the person who, next to
      yourself, is dearest to me in this world, I shall have on my heart, as a
      subject of eternal regret, that being in a certain degree warned of his
      danger and furnished with the means of obviating it, I did not instantly
      hasten to his assistance, but preferred giving my attention to the
      business of this unlucky morning. No view of personal distinction,
      nothing, indeed, short of your earnest and often expressed wishes, could
      have detained me in town till this day; and having made this sacrifice to
      filial duty, I trust you will hold me excused if I now obey the calls of
      friendship and humanity. Do not be in the least anxious on my account; I
      shall know, I trust, how to conduct myself with due caution in any
      emergence which may occur, otherwise my legal studies for so many years
      have been to little purpose. I am fully provided with money, and also with
      arms, in case of need; but you may rely on my prudence in avoiding all
      occasions of using the latter, short of the last necessity. God almighty
      bless you, my dearest father! and grant that you may forgive the first,
      and, I trust, the last act approaching towards premeditated disobedience,
      of which I either have now, or shall hereafter have, to accuse myself. I
      remain, till death, your dutiful and affectionate son, ALAN FAIRFORD.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;PS.&mdash;I shall write with the utmost regularity, acquainting you with
      my motions, and requesting your advice. I trust my stay will be very
      short, and I think it possible that I may bring back Darsie along with
      me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The paper dropped from the old man&rsquo;s hand when he was thus assured of the
      misfortune which he apprehended. His first idea was to get a postchaise
      and pursue the fugitive; but he recollected that, upon the very rare
      occasions when Alan had shown himself indocile to the PATRIA POTESTAS, his
      natural ease and gentleness of disposition seemed hardened into obstinacy,
      and that now, entitled, as arrived at the years of majority and a member
      of the learned faculty, to direct his own motions, there was great doubt,
      whether, in the event of his overtaking his son, he might be able to
      prevail upon him to return back. In such a risk of failure he thought it
      wiser to desist from his purpose, especially as even his success in such a
      pursuit would give a ridiculous ECLAT to the whole affair, which could not
      be otherwise than prejudicial to his son&rsquo;s rising character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bitter, however, were Saunders Fairford&rsquo;s reflections, as again picking up
      the fatal scroll, he threw himself into his son&rsquo;s leathern easy-chair, and
      bestowed upon it a disjointed commentary, &lsquo;Bring back Darsie? little doubt
      of that&mdash;the bad shilling is sure enough to come back again. I wish
      Darsie no worse ill than that he were carried where the silly fool, Alan,
      should never see him again. It was an ill hour that he darkened my doors
      in, for, ever since that, Alan has given up his ain old-fashioned
      mother-wit for the tother&rsquo;s capernoited maggots and nonsense. Provided
      with money? you must have more than I know of, then, my friend, for I trow
      I kept you pretty short, for your own good. Can he have gotten more fees?
      or, does he think five guineas has neither beginning nor end? Arms! What
      would he do with arms, or what would any man do with them that is not a
      regular soldier under government, or else a thief-taker? I have had enough
      of arms, I trow, although I carried them for King George and the
      government. But this is a worse strait than Falkirk field yet. God guide
      us, we are poor inconsistent creatures! To think the lad should have made
      so able an appearance, and then bolted off this gate, after a glaiket
      ne&rsquo;er-do-weel, like a hound upon a false scent! Las-a-day! it&rsquo;s a sore
      thing to see a stunkard cow kick down the pail when it&rsquo;s reaming fou. But,
      after all, it&rsquo;s an ill bird that defiles its ain nest. I must cover up the
      scandal as well as I can. What&rsquo;s the matter now, James?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A message, sir,&rsquo; said James Wilkinson, &lsquo;from my Lord President; and he
      hopes Mr. Alan is not seriously indisposed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From the Lord President? the Lord preserve us!&mdash;I&rsquo;ll send an answer
      this instant; bid the lad sit down, and ask him to drink, James. Let me
      see,&rsquo; continued he, taking a sheet of gilt paper &lsquo;how we are to draw our
      answers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ere his pen had touched the paper, James was in the room again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What now, James?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lord Bladderskate&rsquo;s lad is come to ask how Mr. Alan is, as he left; the
      court&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, aye, aye,&rsquo; answered Saunders, bitterly; &lsquo;he has e&rsquo;en made a
      moonlight flitting, like my lord&rsquo;s ain nevoy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I say sae, sir?&rsquo; said James, who, as an old soldier, was literal in
      all things touching the service.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The devil! no, no!&mdash;Bid the lad sit down and taste our ale. I will
      write his lordship an answer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more the gilt paper was resumed, and once more the door was opened by
      James.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lord &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; sends his servitor to ask after Mr. Alan.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, the deevil take their civility!&rsquo; said poor Saunders, set him down to
      drink too&mdash;I will write to his lordship.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The lads will bide your pleasure, sir, as lang as I keep the bicker fou;
      but this ringing is like to wear out the bell, I think; there are they at
      it again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered the fresh summons accordingly, and came back to inform Mr.
      Fairford that the Dean of Faculty was below, inquiring for Mr. Alan. &lsquo;Will
      I set him down to drink, too?&rsquo; said James.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you be an idiot, sir?&rsquo; said Mr. Fairford. &lsquo;Show Mr. Dean into the
      parlour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In going slowly downstairs, step by step, the perplexed man of business
      had time enough to reflect, that if it be possible to put a fair gloss
      upon a true story, the verity always serves the purpose better than any
      substitute which ingenuity can devise. He therefore told his learned
      visitor, that although his son had been incommoded by the heat of the
      court, and the long train of hard study, by day and night, preceding his
      exertions, yet he had fortunately so far recovered, as to be in condition
      to obey upon the instant a sudden summons which had called him to the
      country, on a matter of life and death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It should be a serious matter indeed that takes my young friend away at
      this moment,&rsquo; said the good-natured dean. &lsquo;I wish he had stayed to finish
      his pleading, and put down old Tough. Without compliment, Mr. Fairford, it
      was as fine a first appearance as I ever heard. I should be sorry your son
      did not follow it up in a reply. Nothing like striking while the iron is
      hot.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Saunders Fairford made a bitter grimace as he acquiesced in an opinion
      which was indeed decidedly his own; but he thought it most prudent to
      reply, &lsquo;that the affair which rendered his son Alan&rsquo;s presence in the
      country absolutely necessary, regarded the affairs of a young gentleman of
      great fortune, who was a particular friend of Alan&rsquo;s, and who never took
      any material step in his affairs without consulting his counsel learned in
      the law.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well, Mr. Fairford, you know best,&rsquo; answered the learned dean; &lsquo;if
      there be death or marriage in the case, a will or a wedding is to be
      preferred to all other business. I am happy Mr. Alan is so much recovered
      as to be able for travel, and wish you a very good morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thus taken his ground to the Dean of Faculty, Mr. Fairford hastily
      wrote cards in answer to the inquiry of the three judges, accounting for
      Alan&rsquo;s absence in the same manner. These, being properly sealed and
      addressed, he delivered to James with directions to dismiss the
      particoloured gentry, who, in the meanwhile, had consumed a gallon of
      twopenny ale, while discussing points of law, and addressing each other by
      their masters&rsquo; titles. [The Scottish judges are distinguished by the title
      of lord prefixed to their own temporal designation. As the ladies of these
      official dignitaries do not bear any share in their husbands&rsquo; honours,
      they are distinguished only by their lords&rsquo; family name. They were not
      always contented with this species of Salique law, which certainly is
      somewhat inconsistent. But their pretensions to title are said to have
      been long since repelled by James V, the sovereign who founded the College
      of Justice. &lsquo;I,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;made the caries lords, but who the devil made
      the carlines ladies?&rsquo;]
    </p>
    <p>
      The exertion which these matters demanded, and the interest which so many
      persons of legal distinction appeared to have taken in his son, greatly
      relieved the oppressed spirit of Saunders Fairford, who continued, to talk
      mysteriously of the very important business which had interfered with his
      son&rsquo;s attendance during the brief remainder of the session. He endeavoured
      to lay the same unction to his own heart; but here the application was
      less fortunate, for his conscience told him that no end, however
      important, which could be achieved in Darsie Latimer&rsquo;s affairs, could be
      balanced against the reputation which Alan was like to forfeit by
      deserting the cause of Poor Peter Peebles.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile, although the haze which surrounded the cause, or causes,
      of that unfortunate litigant had been for a time dispelled by Alan&rsquo;s
      eloquence, like a fog by the thunder of artillery, yet it seemed once more
      to settle down upon the mass of litigation, thick as the palpable darkness
      of Egypt, at the very sound of Mr. Tough&rsquo;s voice, who, on the second day
      after Alan&rsquo;s departure, was heard in answer to the opening counsel.
      Deep-mouthed, long-breathed, and pertinacious, taking a pinch of snuff
      betwixt every sentence, which otherwise seemed interminable&mdash;the
      veteran pleader prosed over all the themes which had been treated so
      luminously by Fairford: he quietly and imperceptibly replaced all the
      rubbish which the other had cleared away, and succeeded in restoring the
      veil of obscurity and unintelligibility which had for many years darkened
      the case of Peebles against Plainstanes; and the matter was once more hung
      up by a remit to an accountant, with instruction to report before answer.
      So different a result from that which the public had been led to expect
      from Alan&rsquo;s speech gave rise to various speculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The client himself opined, that it was entirely owing, first, to his own
      absence during the first day&rsquo;s pleading, being, as he said, deboshed with
      brandy, usquebaugh, and other strong waters, at John&rsquo;s Coffee-house, PER
      AMBAGES of Peter Drudgeit, employed to that effect by and through the
      device, counsel, and covyne of Saunders Fairford, his agent, or pretended
      agent. Secondly by the flight and voluntary desertion of the younger
      Fairford, the advocate; on account of which, he served both father and son
      with a petition and complaint against them, for malversation in office. So
      that the apparent and most probable issue of this cause seemed to menace
      the melancholy Mr. Saunders Fairford, with additional subject for plague
      and mortification; which was the more galling, as his conscience told him
      that the case was really given away, and that a very brief resumption of
      the former argument, with reference to the necessary authorities and
      points of evidence, would have enabled Alan, by the mere breath, as it
      were, of his mouth, to blow away the various cobwebs with which Mr. Tough
      had again invested the proceedings. But it went, he said, just like a
      decreet in absence, and was lost for want of a contradictor.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile, nearly a week passed over without Mr. Fairford hearing a
      word directly from his son. He learned, indeed, by a letter from Mr.
      Crosbie, that the young counsellor had safely reached Dumfries, but had
      left that town upon some ulterior researches, the purpose of which he had
      not communicated. The old man, thus left to suspense, and to mortifying
      recollections, deprived also of the domestic society to which he had been
      habituated, began to suffer in body as well as in mind. He had formed the
      determination of setting out in person for Dumfriesshire, when, after
      having been dogged, peevish, and snappish to his clerks and domestics, to
      an unusual and almost intolerable degree, the acrimonious humours settled
      in a hissing-hot fit of the gout, which is a well-known tamer of the most
      froward spirits, and under whose discipline we shall, for the present,
      leave him, as the continuation of this history assumes, with the next
      division, a form somewhat different from direct narrative and epistolary
      correspondence, though partaking of the character of both.

      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      JOURNAL OF DARSIE LATIMER (The following address is written on the inside
      of the envelope which contained the Journal.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Into what hands soever these leaves may fall, they will instruct him,
      during a certain time at least, in the history of the life of an
      unfortunate young man, who, in the heart of a free country, and without
      any crime being laid to his charge, has been, and is, subjected to a
      course of unlawful and violent restraint. He who opens this letter, is
      therefore conjured to apply to the nearest magistrate, and, following such
      indications as the papers may afford, to exert himself for the relief of
      one, who, while he possesses every claim to assistance which oppressed
      innocence can give, has, at the same time, both the inclination and the
      means of being grateful to his deliverers. Or, if the person obtaining
      these letters shall want courage or means to effect the writer&rsquo;s release,
      he is, in that case, conjured, by every duty of a man to his fellow
      mortals, and of a Christian towards one who professes the same holy faith,
      to take the speediest measures for conveying them with speed and safety to
      the hands of Alan Fairford, Esq., Advocate, residing in the family of his
      father, Alexander Fairford, Esq., Writer to the Signet, Brown&rsquo;s Square,
      Edinburgh. He may be assured of a liberal reward, besides the
      consciousness of having discharged a real duty to humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      MY DEAREST ALAN, Feeling as warmly towards you in doubt and in distress,
      as I ever did in the brightest days of our intimacy, it is to you whom I
      address a history which may perhaps fall into very different hands. A
      portion of my former spirit descends to my pen when I write your name, and
      indulging the happy thought that you may be my deliverer from my present
      uncomfortable and alarming situation, as you have been my guide and
      counsellor on every former occasion, I will subdue the dejection which
      would otherwise overwhelm me. Therefore, as, Heaven knows, I have time
      enough to write, I will endeavour to pour my thoughts out, as fully and
      freely as of old, though probably without the same gay and happy levity.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the papers should reach other hands than yours, still I will not regret
      this exposure of my feelings; for, allowing for an ample share of the
      folly incidental to youth and inexperience, I fear not that I have much to
      be ashamed of in my narrative; nay, I even hope that the open simplicity
      and frankness with which I am about to relate every singular and
      distressing circumstance, may prepossess even a stranger in my favour; and
      that, amid the multitude of seemingly trivial circumstances which I detail
      at length, a clue may be found to effect my liberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another chance certainly remains&mdash;the Journal, as I may call it, may
      never reach the hands, either of the dear friend to whom it is addressed,
      or those of an indifferent stranger, but may become the prey of the
      persons by whom I am at present treated as a prisoner. Let it be so&mdash;they
      will learn from it little but what they already know; that, as a man and
      an Englishman, my soul revolts at the usage which I have received; that I
      am determined to essay every possible means to obtain my freedom; that
      captivity has not broken my spirit, and that, although they may doubtless
      complete their oppression by murder, I am still willing to bequeath my
      cause to the justice of my country. Undeterred, therefore, by the
      probability that my papers may be torn from me, and subjected to the
      inspection of one in particular, who, causelessly my enemy already, may be
      yet further incensed at me for recording the history of my wrongs, I
      proceed to resume the history of events which have befallen me since the
      conclusion of my last letter to my dear Alan Fairford, dated, if I mistake
      not, on the 5th day of this still current month of August.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the night preceding the date of that letter, I had been present, for
      the purpose of an idle frolic, at a dancing party at the village of
      Brokenburn, about six miles from Dumfries; many persons must have seen me
      there, should the fact appear of importance sufficient to require
      investigation. I danced, played on the violin, and took part in the
      festivity till about midnight, when my servant, Samuel Owen, brought me my
      horses, and I rode back to a small inn called Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush, kept by
      Mrs. Gregson, which had been occasionally my residence for about a
      fortnight past. I spent the earlier part of the forenoon in writing a
      letter, which I have already mentioned, to you, my dear Alan, and which, I
      think, you must have received in safety. Why did I not follow your advice,
      so often given me? Why did I linger in the neighbourhood of a danger, of
      which a kind voice had warned me? These are now unavailing questions; I
      was blinded by a fatality, and remained, fluttering like a moth around the
      candle, until I have been scorched to some purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greater part of the day had passed, and time hung heavy on my hands. I
      ought, perhaps, to blush at recollecting what has been often objected to
      me by the dear friend to whom this letter is addressed, viz. the facility
      with which I have, in moments of indolence, suffered my motions to be,
      directed by any person who chanced to be near me, instead of taking the
      labour of thinking or deciding for myself. I had employed for some time,
      as a sort of guide and errand-boy, a lad named Benjamin, the son of one
      widow Coltherd, who lives near the Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush, and I cannot but
      remember that, upon several occasions, I had of late suffered him to
      possess more influence over my motions than at all became the difference
      of our age and condition. At present, he exerted himself to persuade me
      that it was the finest possible sport to see the fish taken out from the
      nets placed in the Solway at the reflux of the tide, and urged my going
      thither this evening so much, that, looking back on the whole
      circumstances, I cannot but think he had some especial motive for his
      conduct. These particulars I have mentioned, that if these papers fall
      into friendly hands, the boy may be sought after and submitted to
      examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eloquence being unable to persuade me that I should take any pleasure
      in seeing the fruitless struggles of the fish when left in the nets and
      deserted by the tide, he artfully suggested, that Mr. and Miss Geddes, a
      respectable Quaker family well known in the neighbourhood and with whom I
      had contracted habits of intimacy, would possibly be offended if I did not
      make them an early visit. Both, he said, had been particularly inquiring
      the reasons of my leaving their house rather suddenly on the previous day.
      I resolved, therefore, to walk up to Mount Sharon and make my apologies;
      and I agreed to permit the boy to attend upon me, and wait my return from
      the house, that I might fish on my way homeward to Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush, for
      which amusement, he assured me, I would find the evening most favourable.
      I mention this minute circumstance, because I strongly suspect that this
      boy had a presentiment how the evening was to terminate with me, and
      entertained the selfish though childish wish of securing to himself an
      angling-rod which he had often admired, as a part of my spoils. I may do
      the boy wrong, but I had before remarked in him the peculiar art of
      pursuing the trifling objects of cupidity proper to his age, with the
      systematic address of much riper years.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we had commenced our walk, I upbraided him with the coolness of the
      evening, considering the season, the easterly wind, and other
      circumstances, unfavourable for angling. He persisted in his own story,
      and made a few casts, as if to convince me of my error, but caught no
      fish; and, indeed, as I am now convinced, was much more intent on watching
      my motions than on taking any. When I ridiculed him once more on his
      fruitless endeavours, he answered with a sneering smile, that &lsquo;the trouts
      would not rise, because there was thunder in the air;&rsquo; an intimation
      which, in one sense, I have found too true.
    </p>
    <p>
      I arrived at Mount Sharon; was received by my friends there with their
      wonted kindness; and after being a little rallied on my having suddenly
      left them on the preceding evening, I agreed to make atonement by staying
      all night, and dismissed the lad who attended with my fishing-rod, to
      carry that information to Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush. It may be doubted whether he
      went thither, or in a different direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betwixt eight and nine o&rsquo;clock, when it began to become dark, we walked on
      the terrace to enjoy the appearance of the firmament, glittering with ten
      million stars; to which a slight touch of early frost gave tenfold lustre.
      As we gazed on this splendid scene, Miss Geddes, I think, was the first to
      point out to our admiration a shooting or falling star, which, she said,
      drew a long train after it. Looking to the part of the heavens which she
      pointed out, I distinctly observed two successive sky-rockets arise and
      burst in the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;These meteors,&rsquo; said Mr. Geddes, in answer to his sister&rsquo;s observation,
      &lsquo;are not formed in heaven, nor do they bode any good to the dwellers upon
      earth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, I looked to another quarter of the sky, and a rocket, as if a
      signal in answer to those which had already appeared, rose high from the
      earth, and burst apparently among the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Geddes seemed very thoughtful for some minutes, and then said to his
      sister, &lsquo;Rachel, though it waxes late. I must go down to the fishing
      station, and pass the night in the overseer&rsquo;s room there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, then,&rsquo; replied the lady, &lsquo;I am but too well assured that the sons of
      Belial are menacing these nets and devices. Joshua, art thou a man of
      peace, and wilt thou willingly and wittingly thrust thyself where thou
      mayst be tempted by the old man Adam within thee, to enter into debate and
      strife?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am a man of peace, Rachel,&rsquo; answered Mr. Geddes, &lsquo;even to the utmost
      extent which our friends can demand of humanity; and neither have I ever
      used, nor, with the help of God, will I at any future time employ, the arm
      of flesh to repel or to revenge injuries. But if I can, by mild reasons
      and firm conduct, save those rude men from committing a crime, and the
      property belonging to myself and others from sustaining damage, surely I
      do but the duty of a man and a Christian.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words, he ordered his horse instantly; and his sister, ceasing
      to argue with him, folded her arms upon her bosom, and looked up to heaven
      with a resigned and yet sorrowful countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      These particulars may appear trivial; but it is better, in my present
      condition, to exert my faculties in recollecting the past, and in
      recording it, than waste them in vain and anxious anticipations of the
      future.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would have been scarcely proper in me to remain in the house from which
      the master was thus suddenly summoned away; and I therefore begged
      permission to attend him to the fishing station, assuring his sister that
      I would be a guarantee for his safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      That proposal seemed to give much pleasure to Miss Geddes. &lsquo;Let it be so,
      brother,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;and let the young man have the desire of his heart,
      that there may be a faithful witness to stand by thee in the hour of need,
      and to report how it shall fare with thee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, Rachel,&rsquo; said the worthy man, &lsquo;thou art to blame in this, that to
      quiet thy apprehensions on my account, thou shouldst thrust into danger&mdash;if
      danger it shall prove to be&mdash;this youth, our guest; for whom,
      doubtless, in case of mishap, as many hearts will ache as may be afflicted
      on our account.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, my good friend,&rsquo; said I, taking Mr. Geddes&rsquo;s hand, &lsquo;I am not so happy
      as you suppose me. Were my span to be concluded this evening, few would so
      much as know that such a being had existed for twenty years on the face of
      the earth; and of these few, only one would sincerely regret me. Do not,
      therefore, refuse me the privilege attending you; and of showing, by so
      trifling an act of kindness, that if I have few friends, I am at least
      desirous to serve them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thou hast a kind heart, I warrant thee,&rsquo; said Joshua Geddes, returning
      the pressure of my hand. &lsquo;Rachel, the young man shall go with me. Why
      should he not face danger, in order to do justice and preserve peace?
      There is that within me,&rsquo; he added, looking upwards, and with a passing
      enthusiasm which I had not before observed and the absence of which
      perhaps rather belonged to the sect than to his own personal character&mdash;&lsquo;I
      say, I have that within which assures me, that though the ungodly may rage
      even like the storm of the ocean, they shall not have freedom to prevail
      against us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Having spoken thus, Mr. Geddes appointed a pony to be saddled for my use;
      and having taken a basket with some provisions, and a servant to carry
      back the horses for which there was no accommodation at the fishing
      station, we set off about nine o&rsquo;clock at night, and after three-quarters
      of an hour&rsquo;s riding, arrived at our place of destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The station consists, or then consisted, of huts for four or five
      fishermen, a cooperage and shed, and a better sort of cottage at which the
      superintendent resided. We gave our horses to the servant, to be carried
      back to Mount Sharon; my companion expressing himself humanely anxious for
      their safety&mdash;and knocked at the door of the house. At first we only
      heard a barking of dogs; but these animals became quiet on snuffing
      beneath the door, and acknowledging the presence of friends. A hoarse
      voice then demanded, in rather unfriendly accents, who we were, and what
      we wanted and it was not; until Joshua named himself, and called upon his
      superintendent to open, that the latter appeared at the door of the hut,
      attended by three large dogs of the Newfoundland breed. He had a flambeau
      in his hand, and two large heavy ship-pistols stuck into his belt. He was
      a stout elderly man, who had been a sailor, as I learned, during the
      earlier part of his life, and was now much confided in by the Fishing
      Company, whose concerns he directed under the orders of Mr. Geddes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thou didst not expect me to-night, friend Davies?&rsquo; said my friend to the
      old man, who was arranging seats for us by the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Master Geddes,&rsquo; answered he, &lsquo;I did not expect you, nor, to speak the
      truth, did I wish for you either.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;These are plain terms: John Davies,&rsquo; answered Mr. Geddes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, aye, sir, I know your worship loves no holiday speeches.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thou dost guess, I suppose, what brings us here so late, John Davies?&rsquo; 
      said Mr. Geddes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do suppose, sir,&rsquo; answered the superintendent, &lsquo;that it was because
      those d&mdash;d smuggling wreckers on the coast are showing their lights
      to gather their forces, as they did the night before they broke down the
      dam-dyke and weirs up the country; but if that same be the case, I wish
      once more you had stayed away, for your worship carries no fighting tackle
      aboard, I think; and there will be work for such ere morning, your
      worship.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Worship is due to Heaven only, John Davies,&rsquo; said Geddes, &lsquo;I have often
      desired thee to desist from using that phrase to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t, then,&rsquo; said John; &lsquo;no offence meant: But how the devil can a man
      stand picking his words, when he is just going to come to blows?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope not, John Davies,&rsquo; said Joshua Geddes. &lsquo;Call in the rest of the
      men, that I may give them their instructions.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I may cry till doomsday Master Geddes, ere a soul answers&mdash;the
      cowardly lubbers have all made sail&mdash;the cooper, and all the rest of
      them, so soon as they heard the enemy were at sea. They have all taken to
      the long-boat, and left the ship among the breakers, except little Phil
      and myself&mdash;they have, by&mdash;!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Swear not at all, John Davies&mdash;thou art an honest man; and I
      believe, without an oath, that thy comrades love their own bones better
      than my goods and chattels. And so thou hast no assistance but little Phil
      against a hundred men or two?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, there are the dogs, your honour knows, Neptune and Thetis&mdash;and
      the puppy may do something; and then though your worship&mdash;I beg
      pardon&mdash;though your honour be no great fighter, this young gentleman
      may bear a hand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, and I see you are provided with arms,&rsquo; said Mr. Geddes; &lsquo;let me see
      them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, aye, sir; here be a pair of buffers will bite as well as bark&mdash;these
      will make sure of two rogues at least. It would be a shame to strike
      without firing a shot. Take care, your honour, they are double-shotted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, John Davies, I will take care of them, throwing the pistols into a
      tub of water beside him; &lsquo;and I wish I could render the whole generation
      of them useless at the same moment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A deep shade of displeasure passed over John Davies&rsquo;s weatherbeaten
      countenance. &lsquo;Belike your honour is going to take the command yourself,
      then?&rsquo; he said, after a pause. &lsquo;Why, I can be of little use now; and since
      your worship, or your honour, or whatever you are, means to strike
      quietly, I believe you will do it better without me than with me, for I am
      like enough to make mischief, I admit; but I&rsquo;ll never leave my post
      without orders.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you have mine, John Davies, to go to Mount Sharon directly, and take
      the boy Phil with you. Where is he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is on the outlook for these scums of the earth,&rsquo; answered Davies; &lsquo;but
      it is to no purpose to know when they come, if we are not to stand to our
      weapons.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We will use none but those of sense and reason, John.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you may just as well cast chaff against the wind, as speak sense and
      reason to the like of them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well, be it so,&rsquo; said Joshua; &lsquo;and now, John Davies, I know thou
      art what the world calls a brave fellow, and I have ever found thee an
      honest one. And now I command you to go to Mount Sharon, and let Phil lie
      on the bank-side&mdash;see the poor boy hath a sea-cloak, though&mdash;and
      watch what happens there, and let him bring you the news; and if any
      violence shall be offered to the property there, I trust to your fidelity
      to carry my sister to Dumfries to the house of our friends the Corsacks,
      and inform the civil authorities of what mischief hath befallen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old seaman paused a moment. &lsquo;It is hard lines for me,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;to
      leave your honour in tribulation; and yet, staying here, I am only like to
      make bad worse; and your honour&rsquo;s sister, Miss Rachel, must be looked to,
      that&rsquo;s certain; for if the rogues once get their hand to mischief, they
      will come to Mount Sharon after they have wasted and destroyed this here
      snug little roadstead, where I thought to ride at anchor for life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Right, right, John Davies,&rsquo; said Joshua Geddes; &lsquo;and best call the dogs
      with you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, aye, sir,&rsquo; said the veteran, &lsquo;for they are something of my mind, and
      would not keep quiet if they saw mischief doing; so maybe they might come
      to mischief, poor dumb creatures. So God bless your honour&mdash;I mean
      your worship&mdash;I cannot bring my mouth to say fare you well. Here,
      Neptune, Thetis! come, dogs, come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, and with a very crestfallen countenance, John Davies left the
      hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now there goes one of the best and most faithful creatures that ever was
      born,&rsquo; said Mr. Geddes, as the superintendent shut the door of the
      cottage. &lsquo;Nature made him with a heart that would not have suffered him to
      harm a fly; but thou seest, friend Latimer, that as men arm their
      bull-dogs with spiked collars, and their game-cocks with steel spurs, to
      aid them in fight, so they corrupt, by education, the best and mildest
      natures, until fortitude and spirit become stubbornness and ferocity.
      Believe me, friend Latimer, I would as soon expose my faithful household
      dog to a vain combat with a herd of wolves, as yon trusty creature to the
      violence of the enraged multitude. But I need say little on this subject
      to thee, friend Latimer, who, I doubt not, art trained to believe that
      courage is displayed and honour attained, not by doing and suffering as
      becomes a man that which fate calls us to suffer and justice commands us
      to do, but because thou art ready to retort violence for violence, and
      considerest the lightest insult as a sufficient cause for the spilling of
      blood, nay, the taking of life. But, leaving these points of controversy
      to a more fit season, let us see what our basket of provision contains;
      for in truth, friend Latimer, I am one of those whom neither fear nor
      anxiety deprives of their ordinary appetite.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We found the means of good cheer accordingly, which Mr. Geddes seemed to
      enjoy as much as if it had been eaten in a situation of perfect safety;
      nay, his conversation appeared to be rather more gay than on ordinary
      occasions. After eating our supper, we left the hut together, and walked
      for a few minutes on the banks of the sea. It was high water, and the ebb
      had not yet commenced. The moon shone broad and bright upon the placid
      face of the Solway Firth, and showed a slight ripple upon the stakes, the
      tops of which were just visible above the waves, and on the dark-coloured
      buoys which marked the upper edge of the enclosure of nets. At a much
      greater distance&mdash;for the estuary is here very wide&mdash;the line of
      the English coast was seen on the verge of the water, resembling one of
      those fog-banks on which mariners are said to gaze, uncertain whether it
      be land or atmospherical delusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We shall be undisturbed for some hours,&rsquo; said Mr. Geddes; &lsquo;they will not
      come down upon us: till the state of the tide permits them to destroy the
      tide-nets. Is it not strange to think that human passions will so soon
      transform such a tranquil scene as this into one of devastation and
      confusion?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed a scene of exquisite stillness; so much so, that the
      restless waves of the Solway seemed, if not absolutely to sleep, at least
      to slumber; on the shore no night-bird was heard&mdash;the cock had not
      sung his first matins, and we ourselves walked more lightly than by day,
      as if to suit the sounds of our own paces to the serene tranquillity
      around us. At length, the plaintive cry of a dog broke the silence, and on
      our return to the cottage, we found that the younger of the three animals
      which had gone along with John Davies, unaccustomed, perhaps, to distant
      journeys, and the duty of following to heel, had strayed from the party,
      and, unable to rejoin them, had wandered back to the place of its birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Another feeble addition to our feeble garrison,&rsquo; said Mr. Geddes, as he
      caressed the dog, and admitted it into the cottage. &lsquo;Poor thing! as thou
      art incapable of doing any mischief, I hope thou wilt sustain none. At
      least thou mayst do us the good service of a sentinel, and permit us to
      enjoy a quiet repose, under the certainty that thou wilt alarm us when the
      enemy is at hand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two beds in the superintendent&rsquo;s room, upon which we threw
      ourselves. Mr. Geddes, with his happy equanimity of temper, was asleep in
      the first five minutes. I lay for some time in doubtful and anxious
      thoughts, watching the fire, and the motions of the restless dog, which,
      disturbed probably at the absence of John Davies, wandered from the hearth
      to the door and back again, then came to the bedside and licked my hands
      and face, and at length, experiencing no repulse to its advances,
      established itself at my feet, and went to sleep, an example which I soon
      afterwards followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rage of narration, my dear Alan&mdash;for I will never relinquish the
      hope that what I am writing may one day reach your hands&mdash;has not
      forsaken me, even in my confinement, and the extensive though unimportant
      details into which I have been hurried, renders it necessary that I
      commence another sheet. Fortunately, my pygmy characters comprehend a
      great many words within a small space of paper.

      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      DARSIE LATIMER&rsquo;S JOURNAL, IN CONTINUATION
    </h3>
    <p>
      The morning was dawning, and Mr. Geddes and I myself were still sleeping
      soundly, when the alarm was given by my canine bedfellow, who first
      growled deeply at intervals, and at length bore more decided testimony to
      the approach of some enemy. I opened the door of the cottage, and
      perceived, at the distance of about two hundred yards, a small but close
      column of men, which I would have taken for a dark hedge, but that I could
      perceive it was advancing rapidly and in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog flew towards them, but instantly ran howling back to me, having
      probably been chastised by a stick or a stone. Uncertain as to the plan of
      tactics or of treaty which Mr. Geddes might think proper to adopt, I was
      about to retire into the cottage, when he suddenly joined me at the door,
      and, slipping his arm through mine, said, &lsquo;Let us go to meet them
      manfully; we have done nothing to be ashamed of.&mdash;Friends,&rsquo; he said,
      raising his voice as we approached them, &lsquo;who and what are you, and with
      what purpose are you here on my property?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A loud cheer was the answer returned, and a brace of fiddlers who occupied
      the front of the march immediately struck up the insulting air, the words
      of which begin&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Merrily danced the Quaker&rsquo;s wife,
  And merrily danced the Quaker.
</pre>
    <p>
      Even at that moment of alarm, I think I recognized the tones of the blind
      fiddler, Will, known by the name of Wandering Willie, from his itinerant
      habits. They continued to advance swiftly and in great order, in their
      front
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  The fiery fiddlers playing martial airs;
</pre>
    <p>
      when, coming close up, they surrounded us by a single movement, and there
      was a universal cry, &lsquo;Whoop, Quaker&mdash;whoop, Quaker! Here have we them
      both, the wet Quaker and the dry one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hang up the wet Quaker to dry, and wet the dry one with a ducking,&rsquo; 
      answered another voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is the sea-otter, John Davies, that destroyed more fish than any
      sealch upon Ailsa Craig?&rsquo; exclaimed a third voice. &lsquo;I have an old crow to
      pluck with him, and a pock to put the feathers in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We stood perfectly passive; for, to have attempted resistance against more
      than a hundred men, armed with guns, fish-spears, iron-crows, spades, and
      bludgeons, would have been an act of utter insanity. Mr. Geddes, with his
      strong sonorous voice, answered the question about the superintendent in a
      manner the manly indifference of which compelled them to attend to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;John Davies,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;will, I trust, soon be at Dumfries&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To fetch down redcoats and dragoons against us, you canting old villain!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A blow was, at the same time, levelled at my friend, which I parried by
      interposing the stick I had in my hand. I was instantly struck down, and
      have a faint recollection of hearing some crying, &lsquo;Kill the young spy!&rsquo; 
      and others, as I thought, interposing on my behalf. But a second blow on
      the head, received in the scuffle, soon deprived me of sense and
      consciousness, and threw me into it state of insensibility, from which I
      did not recover immediately. When I did come to myself, I was lying on the
      bed from which I had just risen before the fray, and my poor companion,
      the Newfoundland puppy, its courage entirely cowed by the tumult of the
      riot, had crept as close to me as it could, and lay trembling and whining,
      as if under the most dreadful terror. I doubted at first whether I had not
      dreamed of the tumult, until, as I attempted to rise, a feeling of pain
      and dizziness assured me that the injury I had sustained was but too real.
      I gathered together my senses listened&mdash;and heard at a distance the
      shouts of the rioters, busy, doubtless, in their work of devastation. I
      made a second effort to rise, or at least to turn myself, for I lay with
      my face to the wall of the cottage, but I found that my limbs were
      secured, and my motions effectually prevented&mdash;not indeed by cords,
      but by linen or cloth bandages swathed around my ankles, and securing my
      arms to my sides. Aware of my utterly captive condition, I groaned betwixt
      bodily pain and mental distress,
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice by my bedside whispered, in a whining tone, &lsquo;Whisht a-ye, hinnie&mdash;Whisht
      a-ye; haud your tongue, like a gude bairn&mdash;ye have cost us dear
      aneugh already. My hinnie&rsquo;s clean gane now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing, as I thought, the phraseology of the wife of the itinerant
      musician, I asked her where her husband was, and whether he had been hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Broken,&rsquo; answered the dame, &lsquo;all broken to pieces; fit for naught but to
      be made spunks of&mdash;the best blood that was in Scotland.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Broken?&mdash;blood?&mdash;is your husband wounded; has there been
      bloodshed broken limbs?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Broken limbs I wish,&rsquo; answered the beldam, &lsquo;that my hinnie had broken the
      best bane in his body, before he had broken his fiddle, that was the best
      blood in Scotland&mdash;it was a Cremony, for aught that I ken.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pshaw&mdash;only his fiddle?&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dinna ken what waur your honour could have wished him to do, unless he
      had broken his neck; and this is muckle the same to my hinnie Willie and
      me. Chaw, indeed! It is easy to say chaw, but wha is to gie us ony thing
      to chaw?&mdash;the bread-winner&rsquo;s gane, and we may e&rsquo;en sit down and
      starve.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I will pay you for twenty such fiddles.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Twenty such! is that a&rsquo; ye ken about it? the country hadna the like o&rsquo;t.
      But if your honour were to pay us, as nae doubt wad be to your credit here
      and hereafter, where are ye to get the siller?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have enough of money,&rsquo; said I, attempting to reach my hand towards my
      side-pocket; &lsquo;unloose these bandages, and I will pay you on the spot.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This hint appeared to move her, and she was approaching the bedside, as I
      hoped, to liberate me from my bonds, when a nearer and more desperate
      shout was heard, as if the rioters were close by the hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I daurna I daurna,&rsquo; said the poor woman, &lsquo;they would murder me and my
      hinnie Willie baith, and they have misguided us aneugh already;&mdash;but
      if there is anything worldly I could do for your honour, leave out loosing
      ye?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      What she said recalled me to my bodily suffering. Agitation, and the
      effects of the usage I had received, had produced a burning thirst. I
      asked for a drink of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heaven Almighty forbid that Epps Ainslie should gie ony sick gentleman
      cauld well-water, and him in a fever. Na, na, hinnie, let me alane, I&rsquo;ll
      do better for ye than the like of that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give me what you will,&rsquo; I replied; &lsquo;let it but be liquid and cool.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman gave me a large horn accordingly, filled with spirits and water,
      which, without minute inquiry concerning the nature of its contents, I
      drained at a draught. Either the spirits taken in such a manner acted more
      suddenly than usual on my brain, or else there was some drug mixed with
      the beverage. I remember little after drinking it off, only that the
      appearance of things around me became indistinct; that the woman&rsquo;s form
      seemed to multiply itself, and to flit in various figures around me,
      bearing the same lineaments as she herself did. I remember also that the
      discordant noises and cries of those without the cottage seemed to die
      away in a hum like that with which a nurse hushes her babe. At length I
      fell into a deep sound sleep, or rather, a state of absolute
      insensibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have reason to think this species of trance lasted for many hours;
      indeed, for the whole subsequent day and part of the night. It was not
      uniformly so profound, for my recollection of it is chequered with many
      dreams, all of a painful nature, but too faint and too indistinct to be
      remembered. At length the moment of waking came, and my sensations were
      horrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      A deep sound, which, in the confusion of my senses, I identified with the
      cries of the rioters, was the first thing of which I was sensible; next, I
      became conscious that I was carried violently forward in some conveyance,
      with an unequal motion, which gave me much pain. My position was
      horizontal, and when I attempted to stretch my hands in order to find some
      mode of securing myself against this species of suffering, I found I was
      bound as before, and the horrible reality rushed on my mind that I was in
      the hands of those who had lately committed a great outrage on property,
      and were now about to kidnap, if not to murder me. I opened my eyes, it
      was to no purpose&mdash;all around me was dark, for a day had passed over
      during my captivity. A dispiriting sickness oppressed my head&mdash;my
      heart seemed on fire, while my feet and hands were chilled and benumbed
      with want of circulation. It was with the utmost difficulty that I at
      length, and gradually, recovered in a sufficient degree the power of
      observing external sounds and circumstances; and when I did so, they
      presented nothing consolatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Groping with my hands, as far as the bandages would permit, and receiving
      the assistance of some occasional glances of the moonlight, I became aware
      that the carriage in which I was transported was one of the light carts of
      the country, called TUMBLERS, and that a little attention had been paid to
      my accommodation, as I was laid upon some sacks covered with matting, and
      filled with straw. Without these, my condition would have been still more
      intolerable, for the vehicle, sinking now on one side, and now on the
      other, sometimes sticking absolutely fast and requiring the utmost
      exertions of the animal which drew it to put it once more in motion, was
      subjected to jolts in all directions, which were very severe. At other
      times it rolled silently and smoothly over what seemed to be wet sand;
      and, as I heard the distant roar of the tide, I had little doubt that we
      were engaged in passing the formidable estuary which divides the two
      kingdoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      There seemed to be at least five or six people about the cart, some on
      foot, others on horseback; the former lent assistance whenever it was in
      danger of upsetting, or sticking fast in the quicksand; the others rode
      before and acted as guides, often changing the direction of the vehicle as
      the precarious state of the passage required.
    </p>
    <p>
      I addressed myself to the men around the cart, and endeavoured to move
      their compassion. I had harmed, I said, no one, and for no action in my
      life had deserved such cruel treatment, I had no concern whatever in the
      fishing station which had incurred their displeasure, and my acquaintance
      with Mr. Geddes was of a very late date. Lastly, and as my strongest
      argument, I endeavoured to excite their fears, by informing them that my
      rank in life would not permit me to be either murdered or secreted with
      impunity; and to interest their avarice, by the promises I made them of
      reward, if they would effect my deliverance. I only received a scornful
      laugh in reply to my threats; my promises might have done more, for the
      fellows were whispering together as if in hesitation, and I began to
      reiterate and increase my offers, when the voice of one of the horsemen,
      who had suddenly come up, enjoined silence to the men on foot, and,
      approaching the side of the cart, said to me, with a strong and determined
      voice, &lsquo;Young man, there is no personal harm designed to you. If you
      remain silent and quiet, you may reckon on good treatment; but if you
      endeavour to tamper with these men in the execution of their duty, I will
      take such measures for silencing you, as you shall remember the longest
      day you have to live.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought I knew the voice which uttered these threats; but, in such a
      situation, my perceptions could not be supposed to be perfectly accurate.
      I was contented to reply, &lsquo;Whoever you are that speak to me, I entreat the
      benefit of the meanest prisoner, who is not to be subjected, legally to
      greater hardship than is necessary for the restraint of his person. I
      entreat that these bonds, which hurt me so cruelly, may be slackened at
      least, if not removed altogether.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will slacken the belts,&rsquo; said the former speaker; &lsquo;nay, I will
      altogether remove them, and allow you to pursue your journey in a more
      convenient manner, provided you will give me your word of honour that you
      will not attempt an escape?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;NEVER!&rsquo; I answered, with an energy of which despair alone could have
      rendered me capable&mdash;&lsquo;I will never submit to loss of freedom a moment
      longer than I am subjected to it by force.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Enough,&rsquo; he replied; &lsquo;the sentiment is natural; but do not on your side
      complain that I, who am carrying on an important undertaking, use the only
      means in my power for ensuring its success.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I entreated to know what it was designed to do with me; but my conductor,
      in a voice of menacing authority, desired me to be silent on my peril; and
      my strength and spirits were too much exhausted to permit my continuing a
      dialogue so singular, even if I could have promised myself any good result
      by doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is proper here to add, that, from my recollections at the time, and
      from what has since taken place, I have the strongest possible belief that
      the man with whom I held this expostulation was the singular person
      residing at Brokenburn, in Dumfriesshire, and called by the fishers of
      that hamlet, the Laird of the Solway Lochs. The cause for his inveterate
      persecution I cannot pretend even to guess at.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, the cart was dragged heavily and wearily on, until the
      nearer roar of the advancing tide excited the apprehension of another
      danger. I could not mistake the sound, which I had heard upon another
      occasion, when it was only the speed of a fleet horse which saved me from
      perishing in the quicksands. Thou, my dear Alan, canst not but remember
      the former circumstances; and now, wonderful contrast! the very man, to
      the best of my belief, who then saved me from peril, was the leader of the
      lawless band who had deprived me of my liberty. I conjectured that the
      danger grew imminent; for I heard some words and circumstances which made
      me aware that a rider hastily fastened his own horse to the shafts of the
      cart in order to assist the exhausted animal which drew it, and the
      vehicle was now pulled forward at a faster pace, which the horses were
      urged to maintain by blows and curses. The men, however, were inhabitants
      of the neighbourhood; and I had strong personal reason to believe that one
      of them, at least, was intimately acquainted with all the depths and
      shallows of the perilous paths in which we were engaged. But they were in
      imminent danger themselves; and if so, as from the whispering and
      exertions to push on with the cart was much to be apprehended, there was
      little doubt that I should be left behind as a useless encumbrance, and
      that, while I was in a condition which rendered every chance of escape
      impracticable. These were awful apprehensions; but it pleased Providence
      to increase them to a point which my brain was scarcely able to endure.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we approached very near to a black line, which, dimly visible as it
      was, I could make out to be the shore, we heard two or three sounds, which
      appeared to be the report of fire-arms. Immediately all was bustle among
      our party to get forward. Presently a fellow galloped up to us, crying
      out, &lsquo;Ware hawk! ware hawk! the land-sharks are out from Burgh, and
      Allonby Tom will lose his cargo if you do not bear a hand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of my company seemed to make hastily for the shore on receiving this
      intelligence. A driver was left with the cart; but at length, when, after
      repeated and hairbreadth escapes, it actually stuck fast in a slough or
      quicksand, the fellow, with an oath, cut the harness, and, as I presume,
      departed with the horses, whose feet I heard splashing over the wet sand
      and through the shallows, as he galloped off.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dropping sound of fire-arms was still continued, but lost almost
      entirely in the thunder of the advancing surge. By a desperate effort I
      raised myself in the cart, and attained a sitting posture, which served
      only to show me the extent of my danger. There lay my native land&mdash;my
      own England&mdash;the land where I was born, and to which my wishes, since
      my earliest age, had turned with all the prejudices of national feeling&mdash;there
      it lay, within a furlong of the place where I yet was; that furlong, which
      an infant would have raced over in a minute, was yet a barrier effectual
      to divide me for ever from England and from life. I soon not only heard
      the roar of this dreadful torrent, but saw, by the fitful moonlight, the
      foamy crests of the devouring waves, as they advanced with the speed and
      fury of a pack of hungry wolves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consciousness that the slightest ray of hope, or power of struggling,
      was not left me, quite overcame the constancy which I had hitherto
      maintained. My eyes began to swim&mdash;my head grew giddy and mad with
      fear&mdash;I chattered and howled to the howling and roaring sea. One or
      two great waves already reached the cart, when the conductor of the party
      whom I have mentioned so often, was, as if by magic, at my side. He sprang
      from his horse into the vehicle, cut the ligatures which restrained me,
      and bade me get up and mount in the fiend&rsquo;s name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing I was incapable of obeying, he seized me as if I had been a child
      of six months old, threw me across the horse, sprang on behind, supporting
      with one hand, while he directed the animal with the other. In my helpless
      and painful posture, I was unconscious of the degree of danger which we
      incurred; but I believe at one time the horse was swimming, or nearly so;
      and that it was with difficulty that my stern and powerful assistant kept
      my head above water. I remember particularly the shock which I felt when
      the animal, endeavouring to gain the bank, reared, and very nearly fell
      back on his burden. The time during which I continued in this dreadful
      condition did not probably exceed two or three minutes, yet so strongly
      were they marked with horror and agony, that they seem to my recollection
      a much more considerable space of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had been thus snatched from destruction, I had only power to say to
      my protector,&mdash;or oppressor,&mdash;for he merited either name at my
      hand, &lsquo;You do not, then, design to murder me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed as he replied, but it was a sort of laughter which I scarce
      desire to hear again,&mdash;&lsquo;Else you think I had let the waves do the
      work? But remember, the shepherd saves his sheep from the torrent&mdash;is
      it to preserve its life?&mdash;Be silent, however, with questions or
      entreaties. What I mean to do, thou canst no more discover or prevent,
      than a man, with his bare palm, can scoop dry the Solway.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was too much exhausted to continue the argument; and, still numbed and
      torpid in all my limbs, permitted myself without reluctance to be placed
      on a horse brought for the purpose. My formidable conductor rode on the
      one side, and another person on the other, keeping me upright in the
      saddle. In this manner we travelled forward at a considerable rate, and by
      by-roads, with which my attendant seemed as familiar as with the perilous
      passages of the Solway.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, after stumbling through a labyrinth of dark and deep lanes, and
      crossing more than one rough and barren heath, we found ourselves on the
      edge of a highroad, where a chaise and four awaited, as it appeared, our
      arrival. To my great relief, we now changed our mode of conveyance; for my
      dizziness and headache had returned in so strong a degree, that I should
      otherwise have been totally unable to keep my seat on horseback, even with
      the support which I received.
    </p>
    <p>
      My doubted and dangerous companion signed to me to enter the carriage&mdash;the
      man who had ridden on the left side of my horse stepped in after me, and
      drawing up the blinds of the vehicle, gave the signal for instant
      departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had obtained a glimpse of the countenance of my new companion, as by the
      aid of a dark lantern the drivers opened the carriage door, and I was
      wellnigh persuaded that I recognized in him the domestic of the leader of
      this party, whom I had seen at his house in Brokenburn on a former
      occasion. To ascertain the truth of my suspicion, I asked him whether his
      name was not Cristal Nixon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is other folk&rsquo;s names to you,&rsquo; he replied, gruffly, &lsquo;who cannot tell
      your own father and mother?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know them, perhaps!&rsquo; I exclaimed eagerly. &lsquo;You know them! and with
      that secret is connected the treatment which I am now receiving? It must
      be so, for in my life have I never injured any one. Tell me the cause of
      my misfortunes, or rather, help me to my liberty, and I will reward you
      richly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, aye,&rsquo; replied my keeper; &lsquo;but what use to give you liberty, who know
      nothing how to use it like a gentleman, but spend your time with Quakers
      and fiddlers, and such like raff! If I was your&mdash;hem, hem, hem!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Cristal stopped short, just on the point, as it appeared, when some
      information was likely to escape him. I urged him once more to be my
      friend, and promised him all the stock of money which I had about me, and
      it was not inconsiderable, if he would assist in my escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened, as if to a proposition which had some interest, and replied,
      but in a voice rather softer than before, &lsquo;Aye, but men do not catch old
      birds with chaff, my master. Where have you got the rhino you are so flush
      of?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will give you earnest directly, and that in banknotes,&rsquo; said I; but
      thrusting my hand into my side-pocket, I found my pocket-book was gone. I
      would have persuaded myself that it was only the numbness of my hands
      which prevented my finding it; but Cristal Nixon, who bears in his
      countenance that cynicism which is especially entertained with human
      misery, no longer suppressed his laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, ho! my young master,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;we have taken good enough care you
      have not kept the means of bribing poor folk&rsquo;s fidelity. What, man, they
      have souls as well as other people, and to make them break trust is a
      deadly sin. And as for me, young gentleman, if you would fill Saint Mary&rsquo;s
      Kirk with gold, Cristal Nixon would mind it no more than so many
      chucky-stones.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I would have persisted, were it but in hopes of his letting drop that
      which it concerned me to know, but he cut off further communication, by
      desiring me to lean back in the corner and go to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thou art cock-brained enough already,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;and we shall have thy
      young pate addled entirely, if you do not take some natural rest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I did indeed require repose, if not slumber; the draught which I had taken
      continued to operate, and, satisfied in my own mind that no attempt on my
      life was designed, the fear of instant death no longer combated the torpor
      which crept over me&mdash;I slept, and slept soundly, but still without
      refreshment.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I awoke, I found myself extremely indisposed; images of the past, and
      anticipations of the future, floated confusedly through my brain. I
      perceived, however, that my situation was changed, greatly for the better.
      I was in a good bed, with the curtains drawn round it; I heard the lowered
      voice and cautious step of attendants, who seemed to respect my repose; it
      appeared as if I was in the hands either of friends, or of such as meant
      me no personal harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can give but an indistinct account of two or three broken and feverish
      days which succeeded, but if they were chequered with dreams and visions
      of terror, other and more agreeable objects were also sometimes presented.
      Alan Fairford will understand me when I say, I am convinced I saw G.M.
      during this interval of oblivion. I had medical attendance, and was bled
      more than once. I also remember a painful operation performed on my head,
      where I had received a severe blow on the night of the riot. My hair was
      cut short, and the bone of the skull examined, to discover if the cranium
      had received any injury.
    </p>
    <p>
      On seeing the physician, it would have been natural to have appealed to
      him on the subject of my confinement, and I remember more than once
      attempting to do so. But the fever lay like a spell upon my tongue, and
      when I would have implored the doctor&rsquo;s assistance, I rambled from the
      subject, and spoke I know not what nonsense. Some power, which I was
      unable to resist, seemed to impel me into a different course of
      conversation from what I intended, and though conscious, in some degree,
      of the failure, I could not mend it; and resolved, therefore, to be
      patient, until my capacity of steady thought and expression was restored
      to me with my ordinary health, which had sustained a severe shock from the
      vicissitudes to which I had been exposed. [See Note 6.]

      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <h3>
      DARSIE LATIMER&rsquo;S JOURNAL, IN CONTINUATION
    </h3>
    <p>
      Two or three days, perhaps more, perhaps less, had been spent in bed,
      where I was carefully attended, and treated, I believe, with as much
      judgement as the case required, and I was at length allowed to quit my
      bed, though not the chamber. I was now more able to make some observation
      on the place of my confinement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room, in appearance and furniture, resembled the best apartment in a
      farmer&rsquo;s house; and the window, two stories high, looked into a backyard,
      or court, filled with domestic poultry. There were the usual domestic
      offices about this yard. I could distinguish the brewhouse and the barn,
      and I heard, from a more remote building, the lowing of the cattle, and
      other rural sounds, announcing a large and well-stocked farm. These were
      sights and sounds qualified to dispel any apprehension of immediate
      violence. Yet the building seemed ancient and strong, a part of the roof
      was battlemented, and the walls were of great thickness; lastly, I
      observed, with some unpleasant sensations, that the windows of my chamber
      had been lately secured with iron stanchions, and that the servants who
      brought me victuals, or visited my apartment to render other menial
      offices, always locked the door when they retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The comfort and cleanliness of my chamber were of true English growth, and
      such as I had rarely seen on the other side of the Tweed; the very old
      wainscot, which composed the floor and the panelling of the room, was
      scrubbed with a degree of labour which the Scottish housewife rarely
      bestows on her most costly furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole apartments appropriated to my use consisted of the bedroom, a
      small parlour adjacent, within which was a still smaller closet having a
      narrow window which seemed anciently to have been used as a shot-hole,
      admitting, indeed, a very moderate portion of light and air, but without
      its being possible to see anything from it except the blue sky, and that
      only by mounting on a chair. There were appearances of a separate entrance
      into this cabinet, besides that which communicated with the parlour, but
      it had been recently built up, as I discovered by removing a piece of
      tapestry which covered the fresh mason-work. I found some of my clothes
      here, with linen and other articles, as well as my writing-case,
      containing pen, ink, and paper, which enables me, at my leisure (which,
      God knows, is undisturbed enough) to make this record of my confinement.
      It may be well believed, however, that I do not trust to the security of
      the bureau, but carry the written sheets about my person, so that I can
      only be deprived of them by actual violence. I also am cautious to write
      in the little cabinet only, so that I can hear any person approach me
      through the other apartments, and have time enough to put aside my journal
      before they come upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servants, a stout country fellow and a very pretty milkmaid-looking
      lass, by whom I am attended, seem of the true Joan and Hedge school,
      thinking of little and desiring nothing beyond the very limited sphere of
      their own duties or enjoyments, and having no curiosity whatever about the
      affairs of others. Their behaviour to me in particular, is, at the same
      time, very kind and very provoking. My table is abundantly supplied, and
      they seem anxious to comply with my taste in that department. But whenever
      I make inquiries beyond &lsquo;what&rsquo;s for dinner&rsquo;, the brute of a lad baffles me
      by his ANAN, and his DUNNA KNAW, and if hard pressed, turns his back on me
      composedly, and leaves the room. The girl, too, pretends to be as simple
      as he; but an arch grin, which she cannot always suppress, seems to
      acknowledge that she understands perfectly well the game which she is
      playing, and is determined to keep me in ignorance. Both of them, and the
      wench in particular, treat me as they would do a spoiled child, and never
      directly refuse me anything which I ask, taking care, at the same time,
      not to make their words good by effectually granting my request. Thus, if
      I desire to go out, I am promised by Dorcas that I shall walk in the park
      at night, and see the cows milked, just as she would propose such an
      amusement to a child. But she takes care never to keep her word, if it is
      in her power to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, there has stolen on me insensibly an indifference to my
      freedom&mdash;a carelessness about my situation, for which I am unable to
      account, unless it be the consequence of weakness and loss of blood. I
      have read of men who, immured as I am, have surprised the world by the
      address with which they have successfully overcome the most formidable
      obstacles to their escape; and when I have heard such anecdotes, I have
      said to myself, that no one who is possessed only of a fragment of
      freestone, or a rusty nail to grind down rivets and to pick locks, having
      his full leisure to employ in the task, need continue the inhabitant of a
      prison. Here, however, I sit, day after day, without a single effort to
      effect my liberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet my inactivity is not the result of despondency, but arises, in part at
      least, from feelings of a very different cast. My story, long a mysterious
      one, seems now upon the verge of some strange development; and I feel a
      solemn impression that I ought to wait the course of events, to struggle
      against which is opposing my feeble efforts to the high will of fate.
      Thou, my Alan, wilt treat as timidity this passive acquiescence, which has
      sunk down on me like a benumbing torpor; but if thou hast remembered by
      what visions my couch was haunted, and dost but think of the probability
      that I am in the vicinity, perhaps under the same roof with G.M., thou
      wilt acknowledge that other feelings than pusillanimity have tended in
      some degree to reconcile me to my fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still I own it is unmanly to submit with patience to this oppressive
      confinement. My heart rises against it, especially when I sit down to
      record my sufferings in this journal, and I am determined, as the first
      step to my deliverance, to have my letters sent to the post-house. &mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I am disappointed. When the girl Dorcas, upon whom I had fixed for a
      messenger, heard me talk of sending a letter, she willingly offered her
      services, and received the crown which I gave her (for my purse had not
      taken flight with the more valuable contents of my pocket-book) with a
      smile which showed her whole set of white teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when, with the purpose of gaining some intelligence respecting my
      present place of abode, I asked to which post-town she was to send or
      carry the letter, a stolid &lsquo;ANAN&rsquo; showed me she was either ignorant of the
      nature of a post-office, or that, for the present, she chose to seem so.&mdash;&lsquo;Simpleton!&rsquo; 
      I said, with some sharpness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O Lord, sir!&rsquo; answered the girl, turning pale, which they always do when
      I show any sparks of anger, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t put yourself in a passion&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      put the letter in the post.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What! and not know the name of the post-town?&rsquo; said I, out of patience.
      &lsquo;How on earth do you propose to manage that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;La you there, good master. What need you frighten a poor girl that is no
      schollard, bating what she learned at the Charity School of Saint Bees?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is Saint Bees far from this place, Dorcas? Do you send your letters
      there?&rsquo; said I, in a manner as insinuating, and yet careless, as I could
      assume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Saint Bees! La, who but a madman&mdash;begging your honour&rsquo;s pardon&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      a matter of twenty years since fader lived at Saint Bees, which is twenty,
      or forty, or I dunna know not how many miles from this part, to the West,
      on the coast side; and I would not have left Saint Bees, but that fader&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, the devil take your father!&rsquo; replied I.
    </p>
    <p>
      To which she answered, &lsquo;Nay, but thof your honour be a little how-come-so,
      you shouldn&rsquo;t damn folk&rsquo;s faders; and I won&rsquo;t stand to it, for one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I beg you a thousand pardons&mdash;I wish your father no ill in the
      world&mdash;he was a very honest man in his way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;WAS an honest man!&rsquo; she exclaimed; for the Cumbrians are, it would seem,
      like their neighbours the Scotch, ticklish on the point of ancestry,&mdash;&lsquo;He
      IS a very honest man as ever led nag with halter on head to Staneshaw Bank
      Fair. Honest! He is a horse-couper.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Right, right,&rsquo; I replied; &lsquo;I know it&mdash;I have heard of your father-as
      honest as any horse-couper of them all. Why, Dorcas, I mean to buy a horse
      of him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, your honour,&rsquo; sighed Dorcas, &lsquo;he is the man to serve your honour well&mdash;if
      ever you should get round again&mdash;or thof you were a bit off the
      hooks, he would no more cheat you than&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well, we will deal, my girl, you may depend on&rsquo;t. But tell me now,
      were I to give you a letter, what would you do to get it forward?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, put it into Squire&rsquo;s own bag that hangs in hall,&rsquo; answered poor
      Dorcas. &lsquo;What else could I do? He sends it to Brampton, or to Carloisle,
      or where it pleases him, once a week, and that gate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;and I suppose your sweetheart John carries it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Noa&mdash;disn&rsquo;t now&mdash;and Jan is no sweetheart of mine, ever since
      he danced at his mother&rsquo;s feast with Kitty Rutlege, and let me sit still;
      that a did.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was most abominable in Jan, and what I could never have thought of
      him,&rsquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, but a did though&mdash;a let me sit still on my seat, a did.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well, my pretty May, you will get a handsomer fellow than Jan&mdash;Jan&rsquo;s
      not the fellow for you, I see that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Noa, noa,&rsquo; answered the damsel; &lsquo;but he is weel aneugh for a&rsquo; that, mon.
      But I carena a button for him; for there is the miller&rsquo;s son, that
      suitored me last Appleby Fair, when I went wi&rsquo; oncle, is a gway canny lad
      as you will see in the sunshine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, a fine stout fellow. Do you think he would carry my letter to
      Carlisle?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To Carloisle! &lsquo;Twould be all his life is worth; he maun wait on clap and
      hopper, as they say. Odd, his father would brain him if he went to
      Carloisle, bating to wrestling for the belt, or sic loike. But I ha&rsquo; more
      bachelors than him; there is the schoolmaster, can write almaist as weel
      as tou canst, mon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then he is the very man to take charge of a letter; he knows the trouble
      of writing one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, marry does he, an tou comest to that, mon; only it takes him four
      hours to write as mony lines. Tan, it is a great round hand loike, that
      one can read easily, and not loike your honour&rsquo;s, that are like midge&rsquo;s
      taes. But for ganging to Carloisle, he&rsquo;s dead foundered, man, as cripple
      as Eckie&rsquo;s mear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the name of God,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;how is it that you propose to get my letter
      to the post?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, just to put it into Squire&rsquo;s bag loike,&rsquo; reiterated Dorcas; &lsquo;he
      sends it by Cristal Nixon to post, as you call it, when such is his
      pleasure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here I was, then, not much edified by having obtained a list of Dorcas&rsquo;s
      bachelors; and by finding myself, with respect to any information which I
      desired, just exactly at the point where I set out. It was of consequence
      to me, however, to accustom, the girl to converse with me familiarly. If
      she did so, she could not always be on her guard, and something, I
      thought, might drop from her which I could turn to advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does not the Squire usually look into his letter-bag, Dorcas?&rsquo; said I,
      with as much indifference as I could assume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That a does,&rsquo; said Dorcas; &lsquo;and a threw out a letter of mine to Raff
      Miller, because a said&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well, I won&rsquo;t trouble him with mine,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;Dorcas; but,
      instead, I will write to himself, Dorcas. But how shall I address him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Anan?&rsquo; was again Dorcas&rsquo;s resource.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I mean how is he called? What is his name?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sure you honour should know best,&rsquo; said Dorcas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know? The devil! You drive me beyond patience.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Noa, noa! donna your honour go beyond patience&mdash;donna ye now,&rsquo; 
      implored the wench. &lsquo;And for his neame, they say he has mair nor ane in
      Westmoreland and on the Scottish side. But he is but seldom wi&rsquo; us,
      excepting in the cocking season; and then we just call him Squoire loike;
      and so do my measter and dame.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And is he here at present?&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not he, not he; he is a buck-hoonting, as they tell me, somewhere up the
      Patterdale way; but he comes and gangs like a flap of a whirlwind, or sic
      loike.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I broke off the conversation, after forcing on Dorcas a little silver to
      buy ribbons, with which she was so much delighted that she exclaimed,
      &lsquo;God! Cristal Nixon may say his worst on thee; but thou art a civil
      gentleman for all him; and a quoit man wi&rsquo; woman folk loike.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no sense in being too quiet with women folk, so I added a kiss
      with my crown piece; and I cannot help thinking that I have secured a
      partisan in Dorcas. At least, she blushed, and pocketed her little
      compliment with one hand, while, with the other, she adjusted her
      cherry-coloured ribbons, a little disordered by the struggle it cost me to
      attain the honour of a salute.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she unlocked the door to leave the apartment, she turned back, and
      looking on me with a strong expression of compassion, added the remarkable
      words, &lsquo;La&mdash;be&rsquo;st mad or no, thou&rsquo;se a mettled lad, after all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something very ominous in the sound of these farewell words,
      which seemed to afford me a clue to the pretext under which I was detained
      in confinement, My demeanour was probably insane enough, while I was
      agitated at once by the frenzy incident to the fever, and the anxiety
      arising from my extraordinary situation. But is it possible they can now
      establish any cause for confining me arising out of the state of my mind?
    </p>
    <p>
      If this be really the pretext under which I am restrained from my liberty,
      nothing but the sedate correctness of my conduct can remove the prejudices
      which these circumstances may have excited in the minds of all who have
      approached me during my illness. I have heard&mdash;dreadful thought!&mdash;of
      men who, for various reasons, have been trepanned into the custody of the
      keepers of private madhouses, and whose brain, after years of misery,
      became at length unsettled, through irresistible sympathy with the
      wretched beings among whom they were classed. This shall not be my case,
      if, by strong internal resolution, it is in human nature to avoid the
      action of exterior and contagious sympathies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime I sat down to compose and arrange my thoughts, for my purposed
      appeal to my jailer&mdash;so I must call him&mdash;whom I addressed in the
      following manner; having at length, and after making several copies, found
      language to qualify the sense of resentment which burned in the first,
      drafts of my letter, and endeavoured to assume a tone more conciliating. I
      mentioned the two occasions on which he had certainly saved my life, when
      at the utmost peril; and I added, that whatever was the purpose of the
      restraint, now practised on me, as I was given to understand, by his
      authority, it could not certainly be with any view to ultimately injuring
      me. He might, I said, have mistaken me for some other person; and I gave
      him what account I could of my situation and education, to correct such an
      error. I supposed it next possible, that he might think me too weak for
      travelling, and not capable of taking care of myself; and I begged to
      assure him, that I was restored to perfect health, and quite able to
      endure the fatigue of a journey. Lastly, I reminded him, in firm though
      measured terms, that the restraint which I sustained was an illegal one,
      and highly punishable by the laws which protect the liberties of the
      subject. I ended by demanding that he would take me before a magistrate;
      or, at least, that he would favour me with a personal interview and
      explain his meaning with regard to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps this letter was expressed in a tone too humble for the situation
      of an injured man, and I am inclined to think so when I again recapitulate
      its tenor. But what could I do? I was in the power of one whose passions
      seem as violent as his means of gratifying them appear unbounded. I had
      reason, too, to believe (this to thee, Alan) that all his family did not
      approve of the violence of his conduct towards me; my object, in fine, was
      freedom, and who would not sacrifice much to attain it?
    </p>
    <p>
      I had no means of addressing my letter excepting &lsquo;For the Squire&rsquo;s own
      hand.&rsquo; He could be at no great distance, for in the course of twenty-four
      hours I received an answer. It was addressed to Darsie Latimer, and
      contained these words: &lsquo;You have demanded an interview with me. You have
      required to be carried before a magistrate. Your first wish shall be
      granted&mdash;perhaps the second also. Meanwhile, be assured that you are
      a prisoner for the time, by competent authority, and that such authority
      is supported by adequate power. Beware, therefore, of struggling with a
      force sufficient to crush you, but abandon yourself to that train of
      events by which we are both swept along, and which it is impossible that
      either of us can resist.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      These mysterious words were without signature of any kind, and left me
      nothing more important to do than to prepare myself for the meeting which
      they promised. For that purpose I must now break off, and make sure of the
      manuscript&mdash;so far as I can, in my present condition, be sure of
      anything&mdash;by concealing it within the lining of my coat, so as not to
      be found without strict search.

      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      LATIMER&rsquo;S JOURNAL, IN CONTINUATION
    </h3>
    <p>
      The important interview expected at the conclusion of my last took place
      sooner than I had calculated; for the very day I received the letter, and
      just when my dinner was finished, the squire, or whatever he is called,
      entered the room so suddenly that I almost thought I beheld an apparition.
      The figure of this man is peculiarly noble and stately, and his voice has
      that deep fullness of accent which implies unresisted authority. I had
      risen involuntarily as he entered; we gazed on each other for a moment in
      silence, which was at length broken by my visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have desired to see me,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I am here; if you have aught to
      say let me hear it; my time is too brief to be consumed in childish
      dumb-show.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would ask of you,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;by what authority I am detained in this
      place of confinement, and for what purpose?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have told you already,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that my authority is sufficient, and
      my power equal to it; this is all which it is necessary for you at present
      to know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Every British subject has a right to know why he suffers restraint,&rsquo; I
      replied; &lsquo;nor can he be deprived of liberty without a legal warrant. Show
      me that by which you confine me thus.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall see more,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;you shall see the magistrate by whom it is
      granted, and that without a moment&rsquo;s delay.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This sudden proposal fluttered and alarmed me; I felt, nevertheless, that
      I had the right cause, and resolved to plead it boldly, although I could
      well have desired a little further time for preparation. He turned,
      however, threw open the door of the apartment, and commanded me to follow
      him. I felt some inclination, when I crossed the threshold of my
      prison-chamber, to have turned and run for it; but I knew not where to
      find the stairs&mdash;had reason to think the outer doors would be secured
      and, to conclude, so soon as I had quitted the room to follow the proud
      step of my conductor, I observed that I was dogged by Cristal Nixon, who
      suddenly appeared within two paces of me, and with whose great personal
      strength, independent of the assistance he might have received from his
      master, I saw no chance of contending. I therefore followed, unresistingly
      and in silence; along one or two passages of much greater length than
      consisted with the ideas I had previously entertained of the size of the
      house. At length a door was flung open, and we entered a large,
      old-fashioned parlour, having coloured glass in the windows, oaken
      panelling on the wall, a huge grate, in which a large faggot or two smoked
      under an arched chimney-piece of stone which bore some armorial device,
      whilst the walls were adorned with the usual number of heroes in armour,
      with large wigs instead of helmets, and ladies in sacques, smelling to
      nosegays.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind a long table, on which were several books, sat a smart
      underbred-looking man, wearing his own hair tied in a club, and who, from
      the quire of paper laid before him, and the pen which he handled at my
      entrance, seemed prepared to officiate as clerk. As I wish to describe
      these persons as accurately as possible, I may add, he wore a
      dark-coloured coat, corduroy breeches, and spatterdashes. At the upper end
      of the same table, in an ample easy-chair covered with black leather,
      reposed a fat personage, about fifty years old, who either was actually a
      country justice, or was well selected to represent such a character. His
      leathern breeches were faultless in make, his jockey boots spotless in the
      varnish, and a handsome and flourishing pair of boot-garters, as they are
      called, united the one part of his garments to the other; in fine, a
      richly-laced scarlet waistcoat and a purple coat set off the neat though
      corpulent figure of the little man, and threw an additional bloom upon his
      plethoric aspect. I suppose he had dined, for it was two hours past noon,
      and he was amusing himself, and aiding digestion, with a pipe of tobacco.
      There was an air of importance in his manner which corresponded to the
      rural dignity of his exterior, and a habit which he had of throwing out a
      number of interjectional sounds, uttered with a strange variety of
      intonation running from bass up to treble in a very extraordinary manner,
      or breaking off his sentences with a whiff of his pipe, seemed adopted to
      give an air of thought and mature deliberation to his opinions and
      decisions. Notwithstanding all this, Alan, it might be DOOTED, as our old
      Professor used to say, whether the Justice was anything more then an ass.
      Certainly, besides a great deference for the legal opinion of his clerk,
      which might be quite according to the order of things, he seemed to be
      wonderfully under the command of his brother squire, if squire either of
      them were, and indeed much more than was consistent with so much assumed
      consequence of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ho&mdash;ha&mdash;aye&mdash;so&mdash;so&mdash;hum&mdash;humph&mdash;this
      is the young man, I suppose&mdash;hum&mdash;aye&mdash;seems sickly. Young
      gentleman, you may sit down.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I used the permission given, for I had been much more reduced by my
      illness than I was aware of, and felt myself really fatigued, even by the
      few paces I had walked, joined to the agitation I suffered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And your name, young man, is&mdash;humph&mdash;aye&mdash;ha&mdash;what is
      it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Darsie Latimer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Right&mdash;aye&mdash;humph&mdash;very right. Darsie Latimer is the very
      thing&mdash;ha&mdash;aye&mdash;where do you come from?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From Scotland, sir,&rsquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A native of Scotland&mdash;a&mdash;humph&mdash;eh&mdash;how is it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am an Englishman by birth, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Right&mdash;aye&mdash;yes, you are so. But pray, Mr. Darsie Latimer, have
      you always been called by that name, or have you any other?&mdash;Nick,
      write down his answers, Nick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As far as I remember, I never bore any other,&rsquo; was my answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How, no? well, I should not have thought so, Hey, neighbour, would you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he looked towards the other squire, who had thrown himself into a
      chair; and, with his legs stretched out before him, and his arms folded on
      his bosom, seemed carelessly attending to what was going forward. He
      answered the appeal of the Justice by saying, that perhaps the young man&rsquo;s
      memory did not go back to a very early period.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah&mdash;eh&mdash;ha&mdash;you hear the gentleman. Pray, how far may your
      memory be pleased to run back to?&mdash;umph?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps, sir, to the age of three years, or a little further.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And will you presume to say, sir,&rsquo; said the squire, drawing himself
      suddenly erect in his seat, and exerting the strength of his powerful
      voice, &lsquo;that you then bore your present name?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was startled at the confidence with which this question was put, and in
      vain rummaged my memory for the means of replying. &lsquo;At least,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I
      always remember being called Darsie; children, at that early age, seldom
      get more than their Christian name.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I thought so,&rsquo; he replied, and again stretched himself on his seat,
      in the same lounging posture as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you were called Darsie in your infancy,&rsquo; said the Justice; &lsquo;and&mdash;hum&mdash;aye&mdash;when
      did you first take the name of Latimer?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did not take it, sir; it was given to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I ask you,&rsquo; said the lord of the mansion, but with less severity in his
      voice than formerly, &lsquo;whether you can remember that you were ever called
      Latimer, until you had that name given you in Scotland?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will be candid: I cannot recollect an instance that I was so called
      when in England, but neither can I recollect when the name was first given
      me; and if anything is to be founded on these queries and my answers, I
      desire my early childhood may be taken into consideration.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hum&mdash;aye&mdash;yes,&rsquo; said the Justice; &lsquo;all that requires
      consideration shall be duly considered. Young man&mdash;eh&mdash;I beg to
      know the name of your father and mother?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was galling a wound that has festered for years, and I did not endure
      the question so patiently as those which preceded it; but replied, &lsquo;I
      demand, in my turn, to know if I am before an English Justice of the
      Peace?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His worship, Squire Foxley, of Foxley Hall, has been of the quorum these
      twenty years,&rsquo; said Master Nicholas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then he ought to know, or you, sir, as his clerk, should inform him,&rsquo; 
      said I, &lsquo;that I am the complainer in this case, and that my complaint
      ought to be heard before I am subjected to cross-examination.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Humph&mdash;hoy&mdash;what, aye&mdash;there is something in that,
      neighbour,&rsquo; said the poor Justice, who, blown about by every wind of
      doctrine, seemed desirous to attain the sanction of his brother squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder at you, Foxley,&rsquo; said his firm-minded acquaintance; &lsquo;how can you
      render the young man justice unless you know who he is?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha&mdash;yes&mdash;egad, that&rsquo;s true,&rsquo; said Mr. Justice Foxley; &lsquo;and now&mdash;looking
      into the matter more closely&mdash;there is, eh, upon the whole&mdash;nothing
      at all in what he says&mdash;so, sir, you must tell your father&rsquo;s name,
      and surname.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is out of my power, sir; they are not known to me, since you must
      needs know so much of my private affairs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Justice collected a great AFFLATUS in his cheeks, which puffed them up
      like those of a Dutch cherub, while his eyes seemed flying out of his
      head, from the effort with which he retained his breath. He then blew it
      forth with,&mdash;&lsquo;Whew!&mdash;Hoom&mdash;poof&mdash;ha!&mdash;not know
      your parents, youngster?&mdash;Then I must commit you for a vagrant, I
      warrant you. OMNE IGNOTUM PRO TERRIBILI, as we used to say at Appleby
      school; that is, every one that is not known to the Justice; is a rogue
      and a vagabond. Ha!&mdash;aye, you may sneer, sir; but I question if you
      would have known the meaning of that Latin, unless I had told you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I acknowledged myself obliged for a new edition of the adage, and an
      interpretation which I could never have reached alone and unassisted. I
      then proceeded to state my case with greater confidence. The Justice was
      an ass, that was clear; but if was scarcely possible he could be so
      utterly ignorant as not to know what was necessary in so plain a case as
      mine. I therefore informed him of the riot which had been committed on the
      Scottish side of the Solway Firth, explained how I came to be placed in my
      present situation, and requested of his worship to set me at liberty. I
      pleaded my cause with as much earnestness as I could, casting an eye from
      time to time upon the opposite party, who seemed entirely indifferent to
      all the animation with which I accused him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the Justice, when at length I had ceased, as really not knowing
      what more to say in a case so very plain, he replied, &lsquo;Ho&mdash;aye&mdash;aye&mdash;yes&mdash;wonderful!
      and so this is all the gratitude you show to this good gentleman for the
      great charge and trouble he hath had with respect to and concerning of
      you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He saved my life, sir, I acknowledge, on one occasion certainly, and most
      probably on two; but his having done so gives him no right over my person.
      I am not, however, asking for any punishment or revenge; on the contrary,
      I am content to part friends with the gentleman, whose motives I am
      unwilling to suppose are bad, though his actions have been, towards me,
      unauthorized and violent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This moderation, Alan, thou wilt comprehend, was not entirely dictated by
      my feelings towards the individual of whom I complained; there were other
      reasons, in which regard for him had little share. It seemed, however, as
      if the mildness with which I pleaded my cause had more effect upon him
      than anything I had yet said. We was moved to the point of being almost
      out of countenance; and took snuff repeatedly, as if to gain time to
      stifle some degree of emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on Justice Foxley, on whom my eloquence was particularly designed to
      make impression, the result was much less favourable. He consulted in a
      whisper with Mr. Nicholas, his clerk&mdash;pshawed, hemmed, and elevated
      his eyebrows, as if in scorn of my supplication. At length, having
      apparently made up his mind, he leaned back in his chair, and smoked his
      pipe with great energy, with a look of defiance, designed to make me aware
      that all my reasoning was lost on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, when I stopped, more from lack of breath than want of argument,
      he opened his oracular jaws, and made the following reply, interrupted by
      his usual interjectional ejaculations, and by long volumes of smoke:&mdash;&lsquo;Hem&mdash;aye&mdash;eh&mdash;poof.
      And, youngster, do you think Matthew Foxley, who has been one of the
      quorum for these twenty years, is to be come over with such trash as would
      hardly cheat an apple-woman? Poof&mdash;poof&mdash;eh! Why, man&mdash;eh&mdash;dost
      thou not know the charge is not a bailable matter&mdash;and that&mdash;hum&mdash;aye&mdash;the
      greatest man&mdash;poof&mdash;the Baron of Graystock himself, must stand
      committed? and yet you pretend to have been kidnapped by this gentleman,
      and robbed of property, and what not; and&mdash;eh&mdash;poof&mdash;you
      would persuade me all you want is to get away from him? I do believe&mdash;eh&mdash;that
      it IS all you want. Therefore, as you are a sort of a slip-string
      gentleman, and&mdash;aye&mdash;hum&mdash;a kind of idle apprentice, and
      something cock-brained withal, as the honest folks of the house tell me&mdash;why,
      you must e&rsquo;en remain under custody of your guardian, till your coming of
      age, or my Lord Chancellor&rsquo;s warrant, shall give you the management of
      your own affairs, which, if you can gather your brains again, you will
      even then not be&mdash;aye&mdash;hem&mdash;poof&mdash;in particular haste
      to assume.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The time occupied by his worship&rsquo;s hums, and haws, and puffs of tobacco
      smoke, together with the slow and pompous manner in which he spoke, gave
      me a minute&rsquo;s space to collect my ideas, dispersed as they were by the
      extraordinary purport of this annunciation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot conceive, sir,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;by what singular tenure this person
      claims my obedience as a guardian; it is a barefaced imposture. I never in
      my life saw him, until I came unhappily to this country, about four weeks
      since.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, sir&mdash;we&mdash;eh&mdash;know, and are aware&mdash;that&mdash;poof&mdash;you
      do not like to hear some folk&rsquo;s names; and that&mdash;eh&mdash;you
      understand me&mdash;there are things, and sounds, and matters,
      conversation about names, and suchlike, which put you off the hooks&mdash;which
      I have no humour to witness. Nevertheless, Mr. Darsie&mdash;or&mdash;poof&mdash;Mr.
      Darsie Latimer&mdash;or&mdash;poof, poof&mdash;eh&mdash;aye, Mr. Darsie
      without the Latimer&mdash;you have acknowledged as much to-day as assures
      me you will best be disposed of under the honourable care of my friend
      here&mdash;all your confessions&mdash;besides that, poof&mdash;eh&mdash;I
      know him to be a most responsible person&mdash;a&mdash;hay&mdash;aye&mdash;most
      responsible and honourable person&mdash;Can you deny this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know nothing of him,&rsquo; I repeated; &lsquo;not even his name; and I have not,
      as I told you, seen him in the course of my whole life, till a few weeks
      since.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you swear to that?&rsquo; said the singular man, who seemed to await the
      result of this debate, secure as a rattle-snake is of the prey which has
      once felt its fascination. And while he said these words in deep
      undertone, he withdrew his chair a little behind that of the Justice, so
      as to be unseen by him or his clerk, who sat upon the same side; while he
      bent on me a frown so portentous, that no one who has witnessed the look
      can forget it during the whole of his life. The furrows of the brow above
      the eyes became livid and almost black, and were bent into a semicircular,
      or rather elliptical form, above the junction of the eyebrows. I had heard
      such a look described in an old tale of DIABLERIE, which it was my chance
      to be entertained with not long since; when this deep and gloomy
      contortion of the frontal muscles was not unaptly described as forming the
      representation of a small horseshoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tale, when told, awaked a dreadful vision of infancy, which the
      withering and blighting look now fixed on me again forced on my
      recollection, but with much more vivacity. Indeed, I was so much
      surprised, and, I must add, terrified, at the vague ideas which were
      awakened in my mind by this fearful sign, that I kept my eyes fixed on the
      face in which it was exhibited, as on a frightful vision; until, passing
      his handkerchief a moment across his countenance, this mysterious man
      relaxed at once the look which had for me something so appalling. &lsquo;The
      young man will no longer deny that he has seen me before,&rsquo; said he to the
      Justice, in a tone of complacency; &lsquo;and I trust he will now be reconciled
      to my temporary guardianship, which may end better for him than he
      expects.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whatever I expect,&rsquo; I replied, summoning my scattered recollections
      together, &lsquo;I see I am neither to expect justice nor protection from this
      gentleman, whose office it is to render both to the lieges. For you, sir,
      how strangely you have wrought yourself into the fate of an unhappy young
      man or what interest you can pretend in me, you yourself only can explain.
      That I have seen you before is certain; for none can forget the look with
      which you seem to have the power of blighting those upon whom you cast
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Justice seemed not very easy under this hint, &lsquo;Ha!&mdash;aye,&rsquo; he said;
      &lsquo;it is time to be going, neighbour. I have a many miles to ride, and I
      care not to ride darkling in these parts. You and I, Mr. Nicholas, must be
      jogging.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Justice fumbled with his gloves, in endeavouring to draw them on
      hastily, and Mr. Nicholas bustled to get his greatcoat and whip. Their
      landlord endeavoured to detain them, and spoke of supper and beds. Both,
      pouring forth many thanks for his invitation, seemed as if they would much
      rather not, and Mr. Justice Foxley was making a score of apologies, with
      at least a hundred cautionary hems and eh-ehs, when the girl Dorcas burst
      into the room, and announced a gentleman on justice business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What gentleman?&mdash;and whom does he want?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is cuome post on his ten toes,&rsquo; said the wench; &lsquo;and on justice
      business to his worship loike. I&rsquo;se uphald him a gentleman, for he speaks
      as good Latin as the schule-measter; but, lack-a-day! he has gotten a
      queer mop of a wig.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman, thus announced and described, bounced into the room. But I
      have already written as much as fills a sheet of my paper, and my singular
      embarrassments press so hard on me that I have matter to fill another from
      what followed the intrusion of&mdash;my dear Alan&mdash;your crazy client&mdash;Poor
      Peter Peebles!

      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      LATIMER&rsquo;S JOURNAL, IN CONTINUATION
    </h3>
    <p>
      Sheet 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have rarely in my life, till the last alarming days, known what it was
      to sustain a moment&rsquo;s real sorrow. What I called such, was, I am now well
      convinced, only the weariness of mind which, having nothing actually
      present to complain of, turns upon itself and becomes anxious about the
      past and the future; those periods with which human life has so little
      connexion, that Scripture itself hath said, &lsquo;Sufficient for the day is the
      evil thereof.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      If, therefore, I have sometimes abused prosperity, by murmuring at my
      unknown birth and uncertain rank in society, I will make amends by bearing
      my present real adversity with patience and courage, and, if I can, even
      with gaiety. What can they&mdash;dare they-do to me? Foxley, I am
      persuaded, is a real Justice of Peace, and country gentleman of estate,
      though (wonderful to tell!) he is an ass notwithstanding; and his
      functionary in the drab coat must have a shrewd guess at the consequences
      of being accessory to an act of murder or kidnapping. Men invite not such
      witnesses to deeds of darkness. I have also&mdash;Alan, I have hopes,
      arising out of the family of the oppressor himself. I am encouraged to
      believe that G.M. is likely again to enter on the field. More I dare not
      here say; nor must I drop a hint which another eye than thine might be
      able to construe. Enough, my feelings are lighter than they have been;
      and, though fear and wonder are still around me, they are unable entirely
      to overcloud the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even when I saw the spectral form of the old scarecrow of the Parliament
      House rush into the apartment where I had undergone so singular an
      examination, I thought of thy connexion with him, and could almost have
      parodied Lear&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Death!&mdash;nothing could have thus subdued nature
  To such a lowness, but his &lsquo;learned lawyers.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      He was e&rsquo;en as we have seen him of yore, Alan, when, rather to keep thee
      company than to follow my own bent, I formerly frequented the halls of
      justice. The only addition to his dress, in the capacity of a traveller,
      was a pair of boots, that seemed as if they might have seen the field of
      Sheriffmoor; so large and heavy that, tied as they were to the creature&rsquo;s
      wearied hams with large bunches of worsted tape of various colours, they
      looked as if he had been dragging them along, either for a wager or by way
      of penance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regardless of the surprised looks of the party on whom he thus intruded
      himself, Peter blundered into the middle of the apartment, with his head
      charged like a ram&rsquo;s in the act of butting, and saluted them thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gude day to ye, gude day to your honours. Is&rsquo;t here they sell the fugie
      warrants?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I observed that on his entrance, my friend&mdash;or enemy&mdash;drew
      himself back, and placed himself as if he would rather avoid attracting
      the observation of the new-comer. I did the same myself, as far as I was
      able; for I thought it likely that Mr. Peebles might recognize me, as
      indeed I was too frequently among the group of young juridical aspirants
      who used to amuse themselves by putting cases for Peter&rsquo;s solution, and
      playing him worse tricks; yet I was uncertain whether I had better avail
      myself of our acquaintance to have the advantage, such as it might be, of
      his evidence before the magistrate, or whether to make him, if possible,
      bearer of a letter which might procure me more effectual assistance. I
      resolved, therefore, to be guided by circumstances, and to watch carefully
      that nothing might escape me. I drew back as far as I could, and even
      reconnoitred the door and passage, to consider whether absolute escape
      might not be practicable. But there paraded Cristal Nixon, whose little
      black eyes, sharp as those of a basilisk, seemed, the instant when they
      encountered mine, to penetrate my purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat down, as much out of sight of all parties as I could, and listened
      to the dialogue which followed&mdash;a dialogue how much more interesting
      to me than any I could have conceived, in which Peter Peebles was to be
      one of the dramatis personae!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it here where ye sell the warrants&mdash;the fugies, ye ken?&rsquo; said
      Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hey&mdash;eh&mdash;what!&rsquo; said Justice Foxley; &lsquo;what the devil does the
      fellow mean?&mdash;What would you have a warrant for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is to apprehend a young lawyer that is IN MEDITATIONE FUGAE; for he
      has ta&rsquo;en my memorial and pleaded my cause, and a good fee I gave him, and
      as muckle brandy as he could drink that day at his father&rsquo;s house&mdash;he
      loes the brandy ower weel for sae youthful a creature.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what has this drunken young dog of a lawyer done to you, that you are
      come to me&mdash;eh&mdash;ha? Has he robbed you? Not unlikely if he be a
      lawyer&mdash;eh&mdash;Nick&mdash;ha?&rsquo; said Justice Foxley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has robbed me of himself, sir,&rsquo; answered Peter; &lsquo;of his help, comfort,
      aid, maintenance, and assistance, whilk, as a counsel to a client, he is
      bound to yield me RATIONE OFFICII&mdash;that is it, ye see. He has pouched
      my fee, and drucken a mutchkin of brandy, and now he&rsquo;s ower the march, and
      left my cause, half won half lost&mdash;as dead a heat as e&rsquo;er was run
      ower the back-sands. Now, I was advised by some cunning laddies that are
      used to crack a bit law wi&rsquo; me in the House, that the best thing I could
      do was to take heart o&rsquo; grace and set out after him; so I have taken post
      on my ain shanks, forby a cast in a cart, or the like. I got wind of him
      in Dumfries, and now I have run him ower to the English side, and I want a
      fugie warrant against him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      How did my heart throb at this information, dearest Alan! Thou art near me
      then, and I well know with what kind purpose; thou hast abandoned all to
      fly to my assistance; and no wonder that, knowing thy friendship and
      faith, thy sound sagacity and persevering disposition, &lsquo;my bosom&rsquo;s lord
      should now sit lightly on his throne&rsquo;; that gaiety should almost
      involuntarily hover on my pen; and that my heart should beat like that of
      a general, responsive to the drums of his advancing ally, without whose
      help the battle must have been lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not suffer myself to be startled by this joyous surprise, but
      continued to bend my strictest attention to what followed among this
      singular party. That Poor Peter Peebles had been put on this wildgoose
      chase by some of his juvenile advisers in the Parliament House, he himself
      had intimated; but he spoke with much confidence, and the Justice, who
      seemed to have some secret apprehension of being put to trouble in the
      matter, and, as sometimes occurs on the English frontier, a jealousy lest
      the superior acuteness of their northern neighbours might overreach their
      own simplicity, turned to his clerk with a perplexed countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eh&mdash;oh&mdash;Nick&mdash;d&mdash;n thee&mdash;Hast thou got nothing
      to say? This is more Scots law, I take it, and more Scotsmen.&rsquo; (Here he
      cast a side-glance at the owner of the mansion, and winked to his clerk.)
      &lsquo;I would Solway were as deep as it is wide, and we had then some chance of
      keeping of them out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas conversed an instant aside with the supplicant, and then
      reported:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The man wants a border-warrant, I think; but they are only granted for
      debt&mdash;now he wants one to catch a lawyer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what for no?&rsquo; answered Peter Peebles, doggedly; &lsquo;what for no, I would
      be glad to ken? If a day&rsquo;s labourer refuse to work, ye&rsquo;ll grant a warrant
      to gar him do out his daurg&mdash;if a wench quean rin away from her
      hairst, ye&rsquo;ll send her back to her heuck again&mdash;if sae mickle as a
      collier or a salter make a moonlight flitting, ye will cleek him by the
      back-spaul in a minute of time&mdash;and yet the damage canna amount to
      mair than a creelfu&rsquo; of coals, and a forpit or twa of saut; and here is a
      chield taks leg from his engagement, and damages me to the tune of sax
      thousand punds sterling; that is, three thousand that I should win, and
      three thousand mair that I am like to lose; and you that ca&rsquo; yourself a
      justice canna help a poor man to catch the rinaway? A bonny like justice I
      am like to get amang ye!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The fellow must be drunk,&rsquo; said the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Black fasting from all but sin,&rsquo; replied the supplicant; &lsquo;I havena had
      mair than a mouthful of cauld water since I passed the Border, and deil a
      ane of ye is like to say to me, &ldquo;Dog, will ye drink?&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Justice seemed moved by this appeal. &lsquo;Hem&mdash;-tush, man,&rsquo; replied
      he; &lsquo;thou speak&rsquo;st to us as if thou wert in presence of one of thine own
      beggarly justices&mdash;get downstairs&mdash;get something to eat, man
      (with permission of my friend to make so free in his house), and a
      mouthful to drink, and I warrant we get ye such justice as will please
      ye.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I winna refuse your neighbourly offer,&rsquo; said Poor Peter Peebles, making
      his bow; &lsquo;muckle grace be wi&rsquo; your honour, and wisdom to guide you in this
      extraordinary cause.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When I saw Peter Peebles about to retire from the room, I could not
      forbear an effort to obtain from him such evidence as might give me some
      credit with the Justice. I stepped forward, therefore, and, saluting him,
      asked him if he remembered me?
    </p>
    <p>
      After a stare or two, and a long pinch of snuff, recollection seemed
      suddenly to dawn on Peter Peebles. &lsquo;Recollect ye!&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;by my troth
      do I.&mdash;-Haud him a grip, gentlemen!&mdash;constables, keep him fast!
      where that ill-deedie hempy is, ye are sure that Alan Fairford is not far
      off. Haud him fast, Master Constable; I charge ye wi&rsquo; him, for I am
      mista&rsquo;en if he is not at the bottom of this rinaway business. He was aye
      getting the silly callant Alan awa wi&rsquo; gigs, and horse, and the like of
      that, to Roslin, and Prestonpans, and a&rsquo; the idle gates he could think of.
      He&rsquo;s a rinaway apprentice, that ane.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Peebles,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;do not do me wrong. I am sure you can say no harm
      of me justly, but can satisfy these gentlemen, if you will, that I am a
      student of law in Edinburgh&mdash;Darsie Latimer by name.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Me satisfy! how can I satisfy the gentlemen,&rsquo; answered Peter, &lsquo;that am
      sae far from being satisfied mysell? I ken naething about your name, and
      can only testify, NIHIL NOVIT IN CAUSA.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A pretty witness you have brought forward in your favour,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Foxley. &lsquo;But&mdash;ha&mdash;aye&mdash;-I&rsquo;ll ask him a question or two.
      Pray, friend, will you take your oath to this youth being a runaway
      apprentice?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said Peter, &lsquo;I will make oath to onything in reason; when a case
      comes to my oath it&rsquo;s a won cause: But I am in some haste to prie your
      worship&rsquo;s good cheer;&rsquo; for Peter had become much more respectful in his
      demeanour towards the Justice since he had heard some intimation of
      dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall have&mdash;eh&mdash;hum&mdash;aye&mdash;a bellyful, if it be
      possible to fill it. First let me know if this young man be really what he
      pretends. Nick, make his affidavit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ow, he is just a wud harum-scarum creature, that wad never take to his
      studies; daft, sir, clean daft.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Deft!&rsquo; said the Justice; &lsquo;what d&rsquo;ye mean by deft&mdash;eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just Fifish,&rsquo; replied Peter; &lsquo;wowf&mdash;a wee bit by the East Nook or
      sae; it&rsquo;s a common case&mdash;the ae half of the warld thinks the tither
      daft. I have met with folk in my day that thought I was daft mysell; and,
      for my part, I think our Court of Session clean daft, that have had the
      great cause of Peebles against Plainstanes before them for this score of
      years, and have never been able to ding the bottom out of it yet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot make out a word of his cursed brogue,&rsquo; said the Cumbrian
      justice; &lsquo;can you, neighbour&mdash;eh? What can he mean by DEFT?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He means MAD,&rsquo; said the party appealed to, thrown off his guard by
      impatience of this protracted discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ye have it&mdash;ye have it,&rsquo; said Peter; &lsquo;that is, not clean skivie, but&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he stopped, and fixed his eye on the person he addressed with an air
      of joyful recognition.&mdash;&lsquo;Aye, aye, Mr. Herries of Birrenswork, is
      this your ainsell in blood and bane? I thought ye had been hanged at
      Kennington Common, or Hairiebie, or some of these places, after the bonny
      ploy ye made in the Forty-five.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe you are mistaken, friend,&rsquo; said Herries, sternly, with whose
      name and designation I was thus made unexpectedly acquainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The deil a bit,&rsquo; answered the undaunted Peter Peebles; I mind ye weel,
      for ye lodged in my house the great year of Forty-five, for a great year
      it was; the Grand Rebellion broke out, and my cause&mdash;the great cause&mdash;Peebles
      against Plainstanes, ET PER CONTRA&mdash;was called in the beginning of
      the winter session, and would have been heard, but that there was a
      surcease of justice, with your plaids, and your piping, and your
      nonsense.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tell you, fellow,&rsquo; said Herries, yet more fiercely, &lsquo;you have confused
      me with some of the other furniture of your crazy pate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Speak like a gentleman, sir,&rsquo; answered Peebles; &lsquo;these are not legal
      phrases, Mr. Herries of Birrenswork. Speak in form of law, or I sall bid
      ye gude day, sir. I have nae pleasure in speaking to proud folk, though I
      am willing to answer onything in a legal way; so if you are for a crack
      about auld langsyne, and the splores that you and Captain Redgimlet used
      to breed in my house, and the girded cask of brandy that ye drank and
      ne&rsquo;er thought of paying for it (not that I minded it muckle in thae days,
      though I have felt a lack of it sin syne), why I will waste an hour on ye
      at ony time.&mdash;and where is Captain Redgimlet now? he was a wild chap,
      like yoursell, though they arena sae keen after you poor bodies for these
      some years bygane; the heading and hanging is weel ower now&mdash;awful
      job&mdash;awful job&mdash;will ye try my sneeshing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He concluded his desultory speech by thrusting out his large bony paw,
      filled with a Scottish mull of huge dimensions, which Herries, who had
      been standing like one petrified by the assurance of this unexpected
      address, rejected with a contemptuous motion of his hand, which spilled
      some of the contents of the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aweel, aweel,&rsquo; said Peter Peebles, totally unabashed by the repulse,
      &lsquo;e&rsquo;en as ye like, a wilful man maun hae his way; but,&rsquo; he added, stooping
      down and endeavouring to gather the spilled snuff from the polished floor,
      &lsquo;I canna afford to lose my sneeshing for a&rsquo; that ye are gumple-foisted wi&rsquo; 
      me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My attention had been keenly awakened, during this extraordinary and
      unexpected scene. I watched, with as much attention as my own agitation
      permitted me to command, the effect produced on the parties concerned. It
      was evident that our friend, Peter Peebles, had unwarily let out something
      which altered the sentiments of Justice Foxley and his clerk towards Mr.
      Herries, with whom, until he was known and acknowledged under that name,
      they had appeared to be so intimate. They talked with each other aside,
      looked at a paper or two which the clerk selected from the contents of a
      huge black pocket-book, and seemed, under the influence of fear and
      uncertainty, totally at a loss what line of conduct to adopt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herries made a different, and far more interesting figure. However little
      Peter Peebles might resemble the angel Ithuriel, the appearance of
      Herries, his high and scornful demeanour, vexed at what seemed detection
      yet fearless of the consequences, and regarding the whispering magistrate
      and his clerk with looks in which contempt predominated over anger or
      anxiety, bore, in my opinion, no slight resemblance to
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     the regal port
  And faded splendour wan
</pre>
    <p>
      with which the poet has invested the detected King of the powers of the
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he glanced round, with a look which he had endeavoured to compose to
      haughty indifference, his eye encountered mine, and, I thought, at the
      first glance sank beneath it. But he instantly rallied his natural spirit,
      and returned me one of those extraordinary looks, by which he could
      contort so strangely the wrinkles on his forehead. I started; but, angry
      at myself for my pusillanimity, I answered him by a look of the same kind,
      and catching the reflection of my countenance in a large antique mirror
      which stood before me, I started again at the real or imaginary
      resemblance which my countenance, at that moment, bore to that of Herries.
      Surely my fate is somehow strangely interwoven with that of this
      mysterious individual. I had no time at present to speculate upon the
      subject, for the subsequent conversation demanded all my attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Justice addressed Herries, after a pause of about five minutes, in
      which, all parties seemed at some loss how to proceed. He spoke with
      embarrassment, and his faltering voice, and the long intervals which
      divided his sentences, seemed to indicate fear of him whom he addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Neighbour,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I could not have thought this; or, if I&mdash;eh&mdash;DID
      think&mdash;in a corner of my own mind as it were&mdash;that you, I say&mdash;that
      you might have unluckily engaged in&mdash;eh&mdash;the matter of the
      Forty-five&mdash;there was still time to have forgot all that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And is it so singular that a man should have been out in the Forty-five?&rsquo; 
      said Herries, with contemptuous composure;&mdash;&lsquo;your father, I think,
      Mr. Foxley, was out with Derwentwater in the Fifteen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And lost half of his estate,&rsquo; answered Foxley, with more rapidity than
      usual; &lsquo;and was very near&mdash;hem&mdash;being hanged into the boot. But
      this is&mdash;another guess job&mdash;for&mdash;eh&mdash;Fifteen is not
      Forty-five; and my father had a remission, and you, I take it, have none.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps I have,&rsquo; said Herries indifferently; &lsquo;or if I have not, I am but
      in the case of half a dozen others whom government do not think worth
      looking after at this time of day, so they give no offence or
      disturbance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you have given both, sir,&rsquo; said Nicholas Faggot, the clerk, who,
      having some petty provincial situation, as I have since understood, deemed
      himself bound to be zealous for government, &lsquo;Mr. Justice Foxley cannot be
      answerable for letting you pass free, now your name and surname have been
      spoken plainly out. There are warrants out against you from the Secretary
      of State&rsquo;s office.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A proper allegation, Mr. Attorney! that, at the distance of so many
      years, the Secretary of State should trouble himself about the unfortunate
      relics of a ruined cause,&rsquo; answered Mr. Herries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But if it be so,&rsquo; said the clerk, who seemed to assume more confidence
      upon the composure of Herries&rsquo;s demeanour; &lsquo;and if cause has been given by
      the conduct of a gentleman himself, who hath been, it is alleged, raking
      up old matters, and mixing them with new subjects of disaffection&mdash;I
      say, if it be so, I should advise the party, in his wisdom, to surrender
      himself quietly into the lawful custody of the next Justice of Peace&mdash;Mr.
      Foxley, suppose&mdash;where, and by whom, the matter should be regularly
      inquired into. I am only putting a case,&rsquo; he added, watching with
      apprehension the effect which his words were likely to produce upon the
      party to whom they were addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And were I to receive such advice,&rsquo; said Herries, with the same composure
      as before&mdash;&lsquo;putting the case, as you say, Mr. Faggot&mdash;I should
      request to see the warrant which countenanced such a scandalous
      proceeding.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Nicholas, by way of answer, placed in his hand a paper, and seemed
      anxiously to expect the consequences which were to ensue. Mr. Herries
      looked it over with the same equanimity as before, and then continued,
      &lsquo;And were such a scrawl as this presented to me in my own house, I would
      throw it into the chimney, and Mr. Faggot upon the top of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, seconding the word with the action, he flung the warrant into
      the fire with one hand, and fixed the other, with a stern and irresistible
      grip, on the breast of the attorney, who, totally unable to contend with
      him, in either personal strength or mental energy, trembled like a chicken
      in the raven&rsquo;s clutch. He got off, however, for the fright; for Herries,
      having probably made him fully sensible of the strength of his grasp,
      released him, with a scornful laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Deforcement&mdash;spulzie-stouthrief&mdash;masterful rescue!&rsquo; exclaimed
      Peter Peebles, scandalized at the resistance offered to the law in the
      person of Nicholas Faggot. But his shrill exclamations were drowned in the
      thundering voice of Herries, who, calling upon Cristal Nixon, ordered him
      to take the bawling fool downstairs, fill his belly, and then give him a
      guinea, and thrust him out of doors. Under such injunctions, Peter easily
      suffered himself to be withdrawn from the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herries then turned to the Justice, whose visage, wholly abandoned by the
      rubicund hue which so lately beamed upon it, hung out the same pale livery
      as that of his dismayed clerk. &lsquo;Old friend and acquaintance,&rsquo; he said,
      &lsquo;you came here at my request on a friendly errand, to convince this silly
      young man of the right which I have over his person for the present. I
      trust you do not intend to make your visit the pretext of disquieting me
      about other matters? All the world knows that I have been living at large,
      in these northern counties, for some months, not to say years, and might
      have been apprehended at any time, had the necessities of the state
      required, or my own behaviour deserved it. But no English magistrate has
      been ungenerous enough to trouble a gentleman under misfortune, on account
      of political opinions and disputes which have been long ended by the
      success of the reigning powers. I trust, my good friend, you will not
      endanger yourself by taking any other view of the subject than you have
      done ever since we were acquainted?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Justice answered with more readiness, as well as more spirit than
      usual, &lsquo;Neighbour Ingoldsby&mdash;what you say&mdash;is&mdash;eh&mdash;in
      some sort true; and when you were coming and going at markets,
      horse-races, and cock-fights, fairs, hunts, and such-like&mdash;it was&mdash;eh&mdash;neither
      my business nor my wish to dispel&mdash;I say&mdash;to inquire into and
      dispel the mysteries which hung about you; for while you were a good
      companion in the field, and over a bottle now and then&mdash;I did not&mdash;eh&mdash;think
      it necessary to ask&mdash;into your private affairs. And if I thought you
      were&mdash;ahem&mdash;somewhat unfortunate in former undertakings, and
      enterprises, and connexions, which might cause you to live unsettledly and
      more private, I could have&mdash;eh&mdash;very little pleasure&mdash;to
      aggravate your case by interfering, or requiring explanations, which are
      often more easily asked than given. But when there are warrants and
      witnesses to names&mdash;and those names, christian and surname, belong to&mdash;eh&mdash;an
      attainted person&mdash;charged&mdash;I trust falsely&mdash;with&mdash;ahem-taking
      advantage of modern broils and heart-burnings to renew our civil
      disturbances, the case is altered; and I must&mdash;ahem&mdash;do my
      duty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Justice, got on his feet as he concluded this speech, and looked as
      bold as he could. I drew close beside him and his clerk, Mr. Faggot,
      thinking the moment favourable for my own liberation, and intimated to Mr.
      Foxley my determination to stand by him. But Mr. Herries only laughed at
      the menacing posture which we assumed. &lsquo;My good neighbour,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you
      talk of a witness. Is yon crazy beggar a fit witness in an affair of this
      nature?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you do not deny that you are Mr. Herries of Birrenswork, mentioned in
      the Secretary of State&rsquo;s warrant?&rsquo; said Mr. Foxley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can I deny or own anything about it?&rsquo; said Herries, with a sneer.
      &lsquo;There is no such warrant in existence now; its ashes, like the poor
      traitor whose doom it threatened, have been dispersed to the four winds of
      heaven. There is now no warrant in the world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you will not deny,&rsquo; said the Justice, &lsquo;that you were the person named
      in it; and that&mdash;eh&mdash;your own act destroyed it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will neither deny my name nor my actions, Justice,&rsquo; replied Mr.
      Herries, &lsquo;when called upon by competent authority to avow or defend them.
      But I will resist all impertinent attempts either to intrude into my
      private motives, or to control my person. I am quite well prepared to do
      so; and I trust that you, my good neighbour and brother sportsman, in your
      expostulation, and my friend Mr. Nicholas Faggot here, in his humble
      advice and petition that I should surrender myself, will consider
      yourselves as having amply discharged your duty to King George and
      government.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The cold and ironical tone in which he made this declaration; the look and
      attitude, so nobly expressive of absolute confidence in his own superior
      strength and energy, seemed to complete the indecision which had already
      shown itself on the side of those whom he addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Justice looked to the clerk&mdash;the clerk to the Justice; the former
      HA&rsquo;D, EH&rsquo;D, without bringing forth an articulate syllable; the latter only
      said, &lsquo;As the warrant is destroyed, Mr. Justice, I presume you do not mean
      to proceed with the arrest?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hum&mdash;aye&mdash;why, no&mdash;Nicholas&mdash;it would not be quite
      advisable&mdash;and as the Forty-five was an old affair&mdash;and&mdash;hem&mdash;as
      my friend here will, I hope, see his error&mdash;that is, if he has not
      seen it already&mdash;and renounce the Pope, the Devil, and the Pretender&mdash;I
      mean no harm, neighbour&mdash;I think we&mdash;as we have no POSSE, or
      constables, or the like&mdash;should order our horses&mdash;and, in one
      word, look the matter over.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Judiciously resolved,&rsquo; said the person whom this decision affected; &lsquo;but
      before you go, I trust you will drink and be friends?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said the Justice, rubbing his brow, &lsquo;our business has been&mdash;hem&mdash;rather
      a thirsty one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cristal Nixon,&rsquo; said Mr. Herries, &lsquo;let us have a cool tankard instantly,
      large enough to quench the thirst of the whole commission.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      While Cristal was absent on this genial errand, there was a pause, of
      which I endeavoured to avail myself by bringing back the discourse to my
      own concerns. &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; I said to Justice Foxley, &lsquo;I have no direct business
      with your late discussion with Mr. Herries, only just thus far&mdash;You
      leave me, a loyal subject of King George, an unwilling prisoner in the
      hands of a person whom you have reason to believe unfriendly to the king&rsquo;s
      cause. I humbly submit that this is contrary to your duty as a magistrate,
      and that you ought to make Mr. Herries aware of the illegality of his
      proceedings, and take steps for my rescue, either upon the spot, or, at
      least, as soon as possible after you have left this case&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Young man,&rsquo; said Mr. Justice Foxley, &lsquo;I would have you remember you are
      under the power, the lawful power&mdash;ahem&mdash;of your guardian.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He calls himself so, indeed,&rsquo; I replied; &lsquo;but he has shown no evidence to
      establish so absurd a claim; and if he had, his circumstances, as an
      attainted traitor excepted from pardon, would void such a right if it
      existed. I do therefore desire you, Mr. Justice, and you, his clerk, to
      consider my situation, and afford me relief at your peril.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here is a young fellow now,&rsquo; said the Justice, with much-embarrassed
      looks, &lsquo;thinks that I carry the whole statute law of England in my head,
      and a POSSE COMITATUS to execute them in my pocket! Why, what good would
      my interference do?&mdash;but&mdash;hum&mdash;eh&mdash;I will speak to
      your guardian in your favour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He took Mr. Herries aside, and seemed indeed to urge something upon him
      with much earnestness; and perhaps such a species of intercession was all
      which, in the circumstances, I was entitled to expect from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They often looked at me as they spoke together; and as Cristal Nixon
      entered with a huge four-pottle tankard, filled with the beverage his
      master had demanded, Herries turned away from Mr. Foxley somewhat
      impatiently, saying with emphasis, &lsquo;I give you my word of honour, that you
      have not the slightest reason to apprehend anything on his account.&rsquo; He
      then took up the tankard, and saying aloud in Gaelic, &lsquo;SLAINT AN REY,&rsquo; 
      [The King&rsquo;s health.] just tasted the liquor, and handed the tankard to
      Justice Foxley, who, to avoid the dilemma of pledging him to what might be
      the Pretender&rsquo;s health, drank to Mr. Herries&rsquo;s own, with much pointed
      solemnity, but in a draught far less moderate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk imitated the example of his principal, and I was fain to follow
      their example, for anxiety and fear are at least as thirsty as sorrow is
      said to be. In a word, we exhausted the composition of ale, sherry,
      lemon-juice, nutmeg, and other good things, stranded upon the silver
      bottom of the tankard the huge toast, as well as the roasted orange, which
      had whilom floated jollily upon the brim, and rendered legible Dr. Byrom&rsquo;s
      celebrated lines engraved thereon&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  God bless the King!&mdash;God bless the Faith&rsquo;s defender!
  God bless&mdash;No harm in blessing&mdash;the Pretender.
  Who that Pretender is, and who that King,&mdash;
  God bless us all!&mdash;is quite another thing.
</pre>
    <p>
      I had time enough to study this effusion of the Jacobite muse, while the
      Justice was engaged in the somewhat tedious ceremony of taking leave. That
      of Mr. Faggot was less ceremonious; but I suspect something besides empty
      compliment passed betwixt him and Mr. Herries; for I remarked that the
      latter slipped a piece of paper into the hand of the former, which might
      perhaps be a little atonement for the rashness with which he had burnt the
      warrant, and imposed no gentle hand on the respectable minion of the law
      by whom it was exhibited; and I observed that he made this propitiation in
      such a manner as to be secret from the worthy clerk&rsquo;s principal.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this was arranged, the party took leave of each other with much
      formality on the part of Squire Foxley, amongst whose adieus the following
      phrase was chiefly remarkable: &lsquo;I presume you do not intend to stay long
      in these parts?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not for the present, Justice, you may be sure; there are good reasons to
      the contrary. But I have no doubt of arranging my affairs so that we shall
      speedily have sport together again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to wait upon the Justice to the courtyard; and, as he did so,
      commanded Cristal Nixon to see that I returned into my apartment. Knowing
      it would be to no purpose to resist or tamper with that stubborn
      functionary, I obeyed in silence, and was once more a prisoner in my
      former quarters.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      LATIMER&rsquo;S JOURNAL, IN CONTINUATION
    </h3>
    <p>
      I spent more than an hour, after returning to the apartment which I may
      call my prison, in reducing to writing the singular circumstances which I
      had just witnessed. Methought I could now form some guess at the character
      of Mr. Herries, upon whose name and situation the late scene had thrown
      considerable light&mdash;one of those fanatical Jacobites, doubtless,
      whose arms, not twenty years since, had shaken the British throne, and
      some of whom, though their party daily diminished in numbers, energy, and
      power, retained still an inclination to renew the attempt they had found
      so desperate. He was indeed perfectly different from the sort of zealous
      Jacobites whom it had been my luck hitherto to meet with. Old ladies of
      family over their hyson, and grey-haired lairds over their punch, I had
      often heard utter a little harmless treason; while the former remembered
      having led down a dance with the Chevalier, and the latter recounted the
      feats they had performed at Preston, Clifton, and Falkirk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The disaffection of such persons was too unimportant to excite the
      attention of government. I had heard, however, that there still existed
      partisans of the Stuart family of a more daring and dangerous description;
      men who, furnished with gold from Rome, moved, secretly and in disguise,
      through the various classes of society, and endeavoured to keep alive the
      expiring zeal of their party.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had no difficulty in assigning an important post among this class of
      persons, whose agency and exertion are only doubted by those who look on
      the surface of things, to this Mr. Herries, whose mental energies, as well
      as his personal strength and activity, seemed to qualify him well to act
      so dangerous a part; and I knew that all along the Western Border, both in
      England and Scotland, there are so many nonjurors, that such a person may
      reside there with absolute safety, unless it becomes, in a very especial
      degree, the object of the government to secure his person; and which
      purpose, even then, might be disappointed by early intelligence, or, as in
      the case of Mr. Foxley, by the unwillingness of provincial magistrates to
      interfere in what is now considered an invidious pursuit of the
      unfortunate.
    </p>
    <p>
      There have, however, been rumours lately, as if the present state of the
      nation or at least of some discontented provinces, agitated by a variety
      of causes but particularly by the unpopularity of the present
      administration, may seem to this species of agitators a favourable period
      for recommencing their intrigues; while, on the other hand, government may
      not, at such a crisis, be inclined to look upon them with the contempt
      which a few years ago would have been their most appropriate punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      That men should be found rash enough to throw away their services and
      lives in a desperate cause, is nothing new in history, which abounds with
      instances of similar devotion&mdash;that Mr. Herries is such an enthusiast
      is no less evident; but all this explains not his conduct towards me. Had
      he sought to make me a proselyte to his ruined cause, violence and
      compulsion were arguments very unlikely to prevail with any generous
      spirit. But even if such were his object, of what use to him could be the
      acquisition of a single reluctant partisan, who could bring only his own
      person to support any quarrel which he might adopt? He had claimed over me
      the rights of a guardian; he had more than hinted that I was in a state of
      mind which could not dispense with the authority of such a person. Was
      this man, so sternly desperate in his purpose&mdash;he who seemed willing
      to take on his own shoulders the entire support of a cause which had been
      ruinous to thousands&mdash;was he the person that had the power of
      deciding on my fate? Was it from him those dangers flowed, to secure me
      against which I had been educated under such circumstances of secrecy and
      precaution?
    </p>
    <p>
      And if this was so, of what nature was the claim which he asserted?&mdash;Was
      it that of propinquity? And did I share the blood, perhaps the features,
      of this singular being?&mdash;Strange as it may seem, a thrill of awe,
      which shot across my mind at that instant, was not unmingled with a wild
      and mysterious feeling of wonder, almost amounting to pleasure. I
      remembered the reflection of my own face in the mirror at one striking
      moment during the singular interview of the day, and I hastened to the
      outward apartment to consult a glass which hung there, whether it were
      possible for my countenance to be again contorted into the peculiar frown
      which so much resembled the terrific look of Herries. But I folded my
      brows in vain into a thousand complicated wrinkles, and I was obliged to
      conclude, either that the supposed mark on my brow was altogether
      imaginary, or that it could not be called forth by voluntary effort; or,
      in fine, what seemed most likely, that it was such a resemblance as the
      imagination traces in the embers of a wood fire, or among the varied veins
      of marble, distinct at one time, and obscure or invisible at another,
      according as the combination of lines strikes the eye or impresses the
      fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I was moulding my visage like a mad player, the door suddenly
      opened, and the girl of the house entered. Angry and ashamed at being
      detected in my singular occupation, I turned round sharply, and, I
      suppose, chance produced the change on my features which I had been in
      vain labouring to call forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl started back, with her &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t ya look so now&mdash;don&rsquo;t ye, for
      love&rsquo;s sake&mdash;you be as like the ould squoire as&mdash;But here a
      comes,&rsquo; she said, huddling away out of the room; &lsquo;and if you want a third,
      there is none but ould Harry, as I know of, that can match ye for a brent
      broo!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As the girl muttered this exclamation, and hastened out of the room,
      Herries entered. He stopped on observing that I had looked again to the
      mirror, anxious to trace the look by which the wench had undoubtedly been
      terrified. He seemed to guess what was passing in my mind, for, as I
      turned towards him, he observed, &lsquo;Doubt not that it is stamped on your
      forehead&mdash;the fatal mark of our race; though it is not now so
      apparent as it will become when age and sorrow, and the traces of stormy
      passions and of bitter penitence, shall have drawn their furrows on your
      brow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mysterious man,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;I know not of what you speak; your language
      is as dark as your purposes!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sit down, then,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and listen; thus far, at least, must the veil
      of which you complain be raised. When withdrawn, it will only display
      guilt and sorrow&mdash;guilt followed by strange penalty, and sorrow which
      Providence has entailed upon the posterity of the mourners.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused a moment, and commenced his narrative, which he told with the
      air of one, who, remote as the events were which he recited, took still
      the deepest interest in them. The tone of his voice, which I have already
      described as rich and powerful, aided by its inflections the effects of
      his story, which I will endeavour to write down, as nearly as possible, in
      the very words which he used.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was not of late years that the English learned that their best chance
      of conquering their independent neighbours must be by introducing amongst
      them division and civil war. You need not be reminded of the state of
      thraldom to which Scotland was reduced by the unhappy wars betwixt the
      domestic factions of Bruce and Baliol, nor how, after Scotland had been
      emancipated from a foreign yoke by the conduct and valour of the immortal
      Bruce, the whole fruits of the triumphs of Bannockburn were lost in the
      dreadful defeats of Dupplin and Halidon; and Edward Baliol, the minion and
      feudatory of his namesake of England, seemed, for a brief season, in safe
      and uncontested possession of the throne so lately occupied by the
      greatest general and wisest prince in Europe. But the experience of Bruce
      had not died with him. There were many who had shared his martial labours,
      and all remembered the successful efforts by which, under circumstances as
      disadvantageous as those of his son, he had achieved the liberation of
      Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The usurper, Edward Baliol, was feasting with a few of his favourite
      retainers in the castle of Annan, when he was suddenly surprised by a
      chosen band of insurgent patriots. Their chiefs were, Douglas, Randolph,
      the young Earl of Moray, and Sir Simon Fraser; and their success was so
      complete, that Baliol was obliged to fly for his life scarcely clothed,
      and on a horse which there was no leisure to saddle. It was of importance
      to seize his person, if possible, and his flight was closely pursued by a
      valiant knight of Norman descent, whose family had been long settled in
      the marches of Dumfriesshire. Their Norman appellation was Fitz-Aldin, but
      this knight, from the great slaughter which he had made of the Southron,
      and the reluctance which he had shown to admit them to quarter during the
      former war of that bloody period, had acquired the name of Redgauntlet,
      which he transmitted to his posterity&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Redgauntlet!&rsquo; I involuntarily repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Redgauntlet,&rsquo; said my alleged guardian, looking at me keenly; &lsquo;does
      that name recall any associations to your mind?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;except that I had lately heard it given to the hero of a
      supernatural legend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There are many such current concerning the family,&rsquo; he answered; and then
      proceeded in his narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alberick Redgauntlet, the first of his house so termed, was, as may be
      supposed from his name, of a stern and implacable disposition, which had
      been rendered more so by family discord. An only son, now a youth of
      eighteen, shared so much the haughty spirit of his father, that he became
      impatient of domestic control, resisted paternal authority, and finally
      fled from his father&rsquo;s house, renounced his political opinions, and
      awakened his mortal displeasure by joining the adherents of Baliol. It was
      said that his father cursed, in his wrath, his degenerate offspring, and
      swore that if they met he should perish by his hand. Meantime,
      circumstances seemed to promise atonement for this great deprivation. The
      lady of Alberick Redgauntlet was again, after many years, in a situation
      which afforded her husband the hope of a more dutiful heir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But the delicacy and deep interest of his wife&rsquo;s condition did not
      prevent Alberick from engaging in the undertaking of Douglas and Moray. He
      had been the most forward in the attack of the castle, and was now
      foremost in the pursuit of Baliol, eagerly engaged in dispersing or
      cutting down the few daring followers who endeavoured to protect the
      usurper in his flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As these were successively routed or slain, the formidable Redgauntlet,
      the mortal enemy of the House of Baliol, was within two lances&rsquo; length of
      the fugitive Edward Baliol, in a narrow pass, when a youth, one of the
      last who attended the usurper in his flight, threw himself between them,
      received the shock of the pursuer, and was unhorsed and overthrown. The
      helmet rolled from his head, and the beams of the sun, then rising over
      the Solway, showed Redgauntlet the features of his disobedient son, in the
      livery, and wearing the cognizance, of the usurper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Redgauntlet beheld his son lying before his horse&rsquo;s feet; but he also saw
      Baliol, the usurper of the Scottish crown, still, as it seemed, within his
      grasp, and separated from him only by the prostrate body of his overthrown
      adherent. Without pausing to inquire whether young Edward was wounded, he
      dashed his spurs into his horse, meaning to leap over him, but was
      unhappily frustrated in his purpose. The steed made indeed a bound
      forward, but was unable to clear the body of the youth, and with its hind
      foot struck him in the forehead, as he was in the act of rising. The blow
      was mortal. It is needless to add, that the pursuit was checked, and
      Baliol escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Redgauntlet, ferocious as he is described, was yet overwhelmed with the
      thoughts of the crime he had committed. When he returned to his castle, it
      was to encounter new domestic sorrows. His wife had been prematurely
      seized with the pangs of labour upon hearing the dreadful catastrophe
      which had taken place. The birth of an infant boy cost her her life.
      Redgauntlet sat by her corpse for more than twenty-four hours without
      changing either feature or posture, so far as his terrified domestics
      could observe. The Abbot of Dundrennan preached consolation to him in
      vain. Douglas, who came to visit in his affliction a patriot of such
      distinguished zeal, was more successful in rousing his attention. He
      caused the trumpets to sound an English point of war in the courtyard, and
      Redgauntlet at once sprang to his arms, and seemed restored to the
      recollection which had been lost in the extent of his misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From that moment, whatever he might feel inwardly, he gave way to no
      outward emotion. Douglas caused his infant to be brought; but even the
      iron-hearted soldiers were struck with horror to observe that, by the
      mysterious law of nature, the cause of his mother&rsquo;s death, and the
      evidence of his father&rsquo;s guilt, was stamped on the innocent face of the
      babe, whose brow was distinctly marked by the miniature resemblance of a
      horseshoe. Redgauntlet himself pointed it out to Douglas, saying, with a
      ghastly smile, &ldquo;It should have been bloody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Moved, as he was, to compassion for his brother-in-arms, and steeled
      against all softer feelings by the habits of civil war, Douglas shuddered
      at this sight, and displayed a desire to leave the house which was doomed
      to be the scene of such horrors. As his parting advice, he exhorted
      Alberick Redgauntlet to make a pilgrimage to Saint Ninian&rsquo;s of Whiteherne,
      then esteemed a shrine of great sanctity; and departed with a
      precipitation which might have aggravated, had that been possible, the
      forlorn state of his unhappy friend. But that seems to have been incapable
      of admitting any addition. Sir Alberick caused the bodies of his
      slaughtered son and the mother to be laid side by side in the ancient
      chapel of his house, after he had used the skill of a celebrated surgeon
      of that time to embalm them; and it was said that for many weeks he spent;
      some hours nightly in the vault where they reposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At length he undertook the proposed pilgrimage to Whiteherne, where he
      confessed himself for the first time since his misfortune, and was shrived
      by an aged monk, who afterwards died in the odour of sanctity. It is said
      that it was then foretold to the Redgauntlet, that on account of his
      unshaken patriotism his family should continue to be powerful amid the
      changes of future times; but that, in detestation of his unrelenting
      cruelty to his own issue, Heaven had decreed that the valour of his race
      should always be fruitless, and that the cause which they espoused should
      never prosper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Submitting to such penance as was there imposed, Sir Alberick went, it is
      thought, on a pilgrimage either to Rome, or to the Holy Sepulchre itself.
      He was universally considered as dead; and it was not till thirteen years
      afterwards, that in the great battle of Durham, fought between David Bruce
      and Queen Philippa of England, a knight, bearing a horseshoe for his
      crest, appeared in the van of the Scottish army, distinguishing himself by
      his reckless and desperate valour; who being at length overpowered and
      slain, was finally discovered to be the brave and unhappy Sir Alberick
      Redgauntlet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And has the fatal sign,&rsquo; said I, when Herries had ended his narrative,
      &lsquo;descended on all the posterity of this unhappy house?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It has been so handed down from antiquity, and is still believed,&rsquo; said
      Herries. &lsquo;But perhaps there is, in the popular evidence, something of that
      fancy which creates what it sees. Certainly, as other families have
      peculiarities by which they are distinguished, this of Redgauntlet is
      marked in most individuals by a singular indenture of the forehead,
      supposed to be derived from the son of Alberick, their ancestor, and
      brother to the unfortunate Edward, who had perished in so piteous a
      manner. It is certain there seems to have been a fate upon the House of
      Redgauntlet, which has been on the losing side in almost all the civil
      broils which have divided the kingdom of Scotland from David Bruce&rsquo;s days,
      till the late valiant and unsuccessful attempt of the Chevalier Charles
      Edward.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He concluded with a deep sigh, as one whom the subject had involved in a
      train of painful reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And am I then,&rsquo; I exclaimed, &lsquo;descended from this unhappy race? Do you
      belong to it? And if so, why do I sustain restraint and hard usage at the
      hands of a relation?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Inquire no further for the present,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;The line of conduct which
      I am pursuing towards you is dictated, not by choice but by necessity. You
      were withdrawn from the bosom of your family and the care of your legal
      guardian, by the timidity and ignorance of a doting mother, who was
      incapable of estimating the arguments or feelings of those who prefer
      honour and principle to fortune, and even to life. The young hawk,
      accustomed only to the fostering care of its dam, must be tamed by
      darkness and sleeplessness, ere it is trusted on the wing for the purposes
      of the falconer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was appalled at this declaration, which seemed to threaten a long
      continuance, and a dangerous termination, of my captivity. I deemed it
      best, however, to show some spirit, and at the same time to mingle a tone
      of conciliation. &lsquo;Mr. Herries,&rsquo; I said &lsquo;(if I call you rightly by that
      name), let us speak upon this matter without the tone of mystery and fear
      in which you seem inclined to envelop it. I have been long, alas! deprived
      of the care of that affectionate mother to whom you allude&mdash;long
      under the charge of strangers&mdash;and compelled to form my own
      resolutions upon the reasoning of my own mind. Misfortune&mdash;early
      deprivation&mdash;has given me the privilege of acting for myself; and
      constraint shall not deprive me of an Englishman&rsquo;s best privilege.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The true cant of the day,&rsquo; said Herries, in a tone of scorn. &lsquo;The
      privilege of free action belongs to no mortal&mdash;we are tied down by
      the fetters of duty&mdash;our mortal path is limited by the regulations of
      honour&mdash;our most indifferent actions are but meshes of the web of
      destiny by which we are all surrounded.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He paced the room rapidly, and proceeded in a tone of enthusiasm which,
      joined to some other parts of his conduct, seems to intimate an
      over-excited imagination, were it not contradicted by the general tenor of
      his speech and conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; he said, in an earnest yet melancholy voice&mdash;&lsquo;nothing is
      the work of chance&mdash;nothing is the consequence of free-will&mdash;the
      liberty of which the Englishman boasts gives as little real freedom to its
      owner as the despotism, of an Eastern sultan permits to his slave. The
      usurper, William of Nassau, went forth to hunt, and thought, doubtless,
      that it was by an act of his own royal pleasure that the horse of his
      murdered victim was prepared for his kingly sport. But Heaven had other
      views; and before the sun was high, a stumble of that very animal over an
      obstacle so inconsiderable as a mole-hillock, cost the haughty rider his
      life and his usurped crown, Do you think an inclination of the rein could
      have avoided that trifling impediment? I tell you, it crossed his way as
      inevitably as all the long chain of Caucasus could have done. Yes, young
      man, in doing and suffering, we play but the part allotted by Destiny, the
      manager of this strange drama, stand bound to act no more than is
      prescribed, to say no more than is set down for us; and yet we mouth about
      free-will and freedom of thought and action, as if Richard must not die,
      or Richmond conquer, exactly where the Author has decreed it shall be so!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He continued to pace the room after this speech, with folded arms and
      downcast looks; and the sound of his steps and tone of his voice brought
      to my remembrance, that I had heard this singular person, when I met him
      on a former occasion, uttering such soliloquies in his solitary chamber. I
      observed that, like other Jacobites, in his inveteracy against the memory
      of King William, he had adopted the party opinion, that the monarch, on
      the day he had his fatal accident, rode upon a horse once the property of
      the unfortunate Sir John Friend, executed for high treason in 1698.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not my business to aggravate, but, if possible, rather to soothe
      him in whose power I was so singularly placed. When I conceived that the
      keenness of his feelings had in some degree subsided, I answered him as
      follows:&mdash;&lsquo;I will not&mdash;indeed I feel myself incompetent to argue
      a question of such metaphysical subtlety, as that which involves the
      limits betwixt free-will and predestination. Let us hope we may live
      honestly and die hopefully, without being obliged to form a decided
      opinion upon a point so far beyond our comprehension.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wisely resolved,&rsquo; he interrupted, with a sneer&mdash;&lsquo;there came a note
      from some Geneva, sermon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But,&rsquo; I proceeded, &lsquo;I call your attention to the fact that I, as well as
      you, am acted upon by impulses, the result either of my own free will, or
      the consequences of the part which is assigned to me by destiny. These may
      be&mdash;nay, at present they are&mdash;in direct contradiction to those
      by which you are actuated; and how shall we decide which shall have
      precedence?&mdash;YOU perhaps feel yourself destined to act as my jailer.
      I feel myself, on the contrary, destined to attempt and effect my escape.
      One of us must be wrong, but who can say which errs till the event has
      decided betwixt us?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall feel myself destined to have recourse to severe modes of
      restraint,&rsquo; said he, in the same tone of half jest, half earnest which I
      had used.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In that case,&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;it will be my destiny to attempt everything
      for my freedom.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And it may be mine, young man,&rsquo; he replied, in a deep and stern tone, &lsquo;to
      take care that you should rather die than attain your purpose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was speaking out indeed, and I did not allow him to go unanswered.
      &lsquo;You threaten me in vain,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;the laws of my country will protect
      me; or whom they cannot protect, they will avenge.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I spoke this firmly, and he seemed for a moment silenced; and the scorn
      with which he at last answered me, had something of affectation in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The laws!&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;and what, stripling, do you know of the laws of your
      country? Could you learn jurisprudence under a base-born blotter of
      parchment, such as Saunders Fairford; or from the empty pedantic coxcomb,
      his son, who now, forsooth, writer himself advocate? When Scotland was
      herself, and had her own king and legislature, such plebeian cubs, instead
      of being called to the bar of her supreme courts, would scarce have been
      admitted to the honour of bearing a sheepskin process-bag.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan, I could not bear this, but answered indignantly, that he knew not
      the worth and honour from which he was detracting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know as much of these Fairfords as I do of you,&rsquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As much,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and as little; for you can neither estimate their real
      worth nor mine. I know you saw them when last in Edinburgh.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; he exclaimed, and turned on me an inquisitive look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is true,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;you cannot deny it; and having thus shown you that
      I know something of your motions, let me warn you I have modes of
      communication with which you are not acquainted. Oblige me not to use them
      to your prejudice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Prejudice me!&rsquo; he replied. &lsquo;Young man, I smile at, and forgive your
      folly. Nay, I will tell you that of which you are not aware, namely, that
      it was from letters received from these Fairfords that I first suspected,
      what the result of my visit to them confirmed, that you were the person
      whom I had sought for years.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you learned this,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;from the papers which were about my person
      on the night when I was under the necessity of becoming your guest at
      Brokenburn, I do not envy your indifference to the means of acquiring
      information. It was dishonourable to&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Peace, young man,&rsquo; said Herries, more calmly than I might have expected;
      &lsquo;the word dishonour must not be mentioned as in conjunction with my name.
      Your pocket-book was in the pocket of your coat, and did not escape the
      curiosity of another, though it would have been sacred from mine, My
      servant, Cristal Nixon, brought me the intelligence after you were gone. I
      was displeased with the manner in which he had acquired his information;
      but it was not the less my duty to ascertain its truth, and for that
      purpose I went to Edinburgh. I was in hopes to persuade Mr. Fairford to
      have entered into my views; but I found him too much prejudiced to permit
      me to trust him. He is a wretched, yet a timid slave of the present
      government, under which our unhappy country is dishonourably enthralled;
      and it would have been altogether unfit and unsafe to have entrusted him
      with the secret either of the right which I possess to direct your
      actions, or of the manner in which I purpose to exercise it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was determined to take advantage of his communicative humour, and
      obtain, if possible, more light upon his purpose. He seemed most
      accessible to being piqued on the point of honour, and I resolved to avail
      myself, but with caution, of his sensibility upon that topic. &lsquo;You say,&rsquo; I
      replied, &lsquo;that you are not friendly to indirect practices, and disapprove
      of the means by which your domestic obtained information of my name and
      quality&mdash;Is it honourable to avail yourself of that knowledge which
      is dishonourably obtained?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is boldly asked,&rsquo; he replied; &lsquo;but, within certain necessary limits, I
      dislike not boldness of expostulation. You have, in this short conference,
      displayed more character and energy than I was prepared to expect. You
      will, I trust, resemble a forest plant, which has indeed, by some
      accident, been brought up in the greenhouse, and thus rendered delicate
      and effeminate, but which regains its native firmness and tenacity when
      exposed for a season to the winter air. I will answer your question
      plainly. In business, as in war, spies and informers are necessary evils,
      which all good men detest; but which yet all prudent men must use, unless
      they mean to fight and act blindfold. But nothing can justify the use of
      falsehood and treachery in our own person.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You said to the elder Mr. Fairford,&rsquo; continued I, with the same boldness,
      which I began to find was my best game, &lsquo;that I was the son of Ralph
      Latimer of Langcote Hall? How do you reconcile this with your late
      assertion that my name is not Latimer?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He coloured as he replied, &lsquo;The doting old fool lied; or perhaps mistook
      my meaning. I said, that gentleman might be your father. To say truth, I
      wished you to visit England, your native country; because, when you might
      do so, my rights over you would revive.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This speech fully led me to understand a caution which had been often
      impressed upon me, that, if I regarded my safety, I should not cross the
      southern Border; and I cursed my own folly, which kept me fluttering like
      a moth around the candle, until I was betrayed into the calamity with
      which I had dallied. &lsquo;What are those rights,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;which you claim
      over me? To what end do you propose to turn them?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To a weighty one, you may be certain,&rsquo; answered Mr. Herries; &lsquo;but I do
      not, at present, mean to communicate to you either its nature or extent.
      You may judge of its importance, when, in order entirely to possess myself
      of your person, I condescended to mix myself with the fellows who
      destroyed the fishing station of yon wretched Quaker. That I held him in
      contempt, and was displeased at the greedy devices with which he ruined a
      manly sport, is true enough; but, unless as it favoured my designs on you,
      he might have, for me, maintained his stake-nets till Solway should cease
      to ebb and flow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;it doubles my regret to have been the unwilling cause of
      misfortune to an honest and friendly man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not grieve for that,&rsquo; said Herries; &lsquo;honest Joshua is one of those
      who, by dint of long prayers, can possess themselves of widow&rsquo;s houses&mdash;he
      will quickly repair his losses. When he sustains any mishap, he and the
      other canters set it down as a debt against Heaven, and, by way of
      set-off, practise rogueries without compunction, till the they make the
      balance even, or incline it to the winning side. Enough of this for the
      present.&mdash;I must immediately shift my quarters; for, although I do
      not fear the over-zeal of Mr. Justice Foxley or his clerk will lead them
      to any extreme measure, yet that mad scoundrel&rsquo;s unhappy recognition of me
      may make it more serious for them to connive at me, and I must not put
      their patience to an over severe trial. You must prepare to attend me,
      either as a captive or a companion; if as the latter, you must give your
      parole of honour to attempt no escape. Should you be so ill advised as to
      break your word once pledged, be assured that I will blow your brains out
      without a moment&rsquo;s scruple.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am ignorant of your plans and purposes,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;and cannot but
      hold them dangerous. I do not mean to aggravate my present situation by
      any unavailing resistance to the superior force which detains me; but I
      will not renounce the right of asserting my natural freedom should it
      favourable opportunity occur. I will, therefore, rather be your prisoner
      than your confederate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is spoken fairly,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;and yet not without the canny caution
      of one brought up in the Gude Town of Edinburgh. On my part, I will impose
      no unnecessary hardship upon you; but, on the contrary, your journey shall
      be made as easy as is consistent with your being kept safely. Do you feel
      strong enough to ride on horseback as yet, or would you prefer a carriage?
      The former mode of travelling is best adapted to the country through which
      we are to travel, but you are at liberty to choose between them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I said, &lsquo;I felt my strength gradually returning, and that I should much
      prefer travelling on horseback. A carriage,&rsquo; I added, &lsquo;is so close&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And so easily guarded,&rsquo; replied Herries, with a look as if he would have
      penetrated my very thoughts,&mdash;&lsquo;that, doubtless, you think horseback
      better calculated for an escape.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My thoughts are my own,&rsquo; I answered; &lsquo;and though you keep my person
      prisoner, these are beyond your control.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I can read the book,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;without opening the leaves. But I
      would recommend to you to make no rash attempt, and it will be my care to
      see that you have no power to make any that is likely to be effectual.
      Linen, and all other necessaries for one in your circumstances, are amply
      provided, Cristal Nixon will act as your valet,&mdash;I should rather,
      perhaps, say, your FEMME DE CHAMBRE. Your travelling dress you may perhaps
      consider as singular; but it is such as the circumstances require; and, if
      you object to use the articles prepared for your use, your mode of
      journeying will be as personally unpleasant as that which conducted you
      hither.&mdash;Adieu&mdash;We now know each other better than we did&mdash;it
      will not be my fault if the consequences of further intimacy be not a more
      favourable mutual opinion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He then left me, with a civil good night, to my own reflections, and only
      turned back to say that we should proceed on our journey at daybreak next
      morning, at furthest; perhaps earlier, he said; but complimented me by
      supposing that, as I was a sportsman, I must always be ready for a sudden
      start.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are then at issue, this singular man and myself. His personal views are
      to a certain point explained. He has chosen an antiquated and desperate
      line of politics, and he claims, from some pretended tie of guardianship
      or relationship, which he does not deign to explain but which he seems to
      have been able to pass current on a silly country Justice and his knavish
      clerk, a right to direct and to control my motions. The danger which
      awaited me in England, and which I might have escaped had I remained in
      Scotland, was doubtless occasioned by the authority of this man. But what
      my poor mother might fear for me as a child&mdash;what my English friend,
      Samuel Griffiths, endeavoured to guard against during my youth and nonage,
      is now, it seems, come upon me; and, under a legal pretext, I am detained
      in what must be a most illegal manner, by a person, foe, whose own
      political immunities have been forfeited by his conduct. It matters not&mdash;my
      mind is made up neither persuasion nor threats shall force me into the
      desperate designs which this man meditates. Whether I am of the trifling
      consequence which my life hitherto seems to intimate, or whether I have
      (as would appear from my adversary&rsquo;s conduct) such importance, by birth or
      fortune, as may make me a desirable acquisition to a political faction, my
      resolution is taken in either case. Those who read this journal, if it
      shall be perused by impartial eyes, shall judge of me truly; and if they
      consider me as a fool in encountering danger unnecessarily, they shall
      have no reason to believe me a coward or a turncoat, when I find myself
      engaged in it. I have been bred in sentiments of attachment to the family
      on the throne and in these sentiments I will live and die. I have, indeed,
      some idea that Mr. Herries has already discovered that I am made of
      different and more unmalleable metal than he had at first believed. There
      were letters from my dear Alan Fairford, giving a ludicrous account of my
      instability of temper, in the same pocket-book, which, according to the
      admission of my pretended guardian, fell under the investigation of his
      domestic during the night I passed at Brokenburn, where, as I now
      recollect, my wet clothes, with the contents of my pockets, were, with the
      thoughtlessness of a young traveller, committed too rashly to the care of
      a strange servant. And my kind friend and hospitable landlord, Mr.
      Alexander Fairford, may also, and with justice, have spoken of my levities
      to this man. But he shall find he has made a false estimate upon these
      plausible grounds, since&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I must break off for the present.

      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      LATIMER&rsquo;S JOURNAL, IN CONTINUATION
    </h3>
    <p>
      There is at length a halt&mdash;at length I have gained so much privacy as
      to enable me to continue my journal. It has become a sort of task of duty
      to me, without the discharge of which I do not feel that the business of
      the day is performed. True, no friendly eye may ever look upon these
      labours, which have amused the solitary hours of an unhappy prisoner. Yet,
      in the meanwhile, the exercise of the pen seems to act as a sedative upon
      my own agitated thoughts and tumultuous passions. I never lay it down but
      I rise stronger in resolution, more ardent in hope. A thousand vague
      fears, wild expectations, and indigested schemes, hurry through one&rsquo;s
      thoughts in seasons of doubt and of danger. But by arresting them as they
      flit across the mind, by throwing them on paper, and even by that
      mechanical act compelling ourselves to consider them with scrupulous and
      minute attention, we may perhaps escape becoming the dupes of our own
      excited imagination; just as a young horse is cured of the vice of
      starting by being made to stand still and look for some time without any
      interruption at the cause of its terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      There remains but one risk, which is that of discovery. But besides the
      small characters, in which my residence in Mr. Fairford&rsquo;s house enabled me
      to excel, for the purpose of transferring as many scroll sheets as
      possible to a huge sheet of stamped paper, I have, as I have elsewhere
      intimated, had hitherto the comfortable reflection that if the record of
      my misfortunes should fall into the hands of him by whom they are caused,
      they would, without harming any one, show him the real character and
      disposition of the person who has become his prisoner&mdash;perhaps his
      victim. Now, however, that other names, and other characters, are to be
      mingled with the register of my own sentiments, I must take additional
      care of these papers, and keep them in such a manner that, in case of the
      least hazard of detection, I may be able to destroy them at a moment&rsquo;s
      notice. I shall not soon or easily forget the lesson I have been taught,
      by the prying disposition which Cristal Nixon, this man&rsquo;s agent and
      confederate, manifested at Brokenburn, and which proved the original cause
      of my sufferings.
    </p>
    <p>
      My laying aside the last sheet of my journal hastily was occasioned by the
      unwonted sound of a violin, in the farmyard beneath my windows. It will
      not appear surprising to those who have made music their study, that,
      after listening to a few notes, I became at once assured that the musician
      was no other than the itinerant, formerly mentioned as present at the
      destruction of Joshua Geddes&rsquo;s stake-nets, the superior delicacy and force
      of whose execution would enable me to swear to his bow amongst a whole
      orchestra. I had the less reason to doubt his identity, because he played
      twice over the beautiful Scottish air called Wandering Willie; and I could
      not help concluding that he did so for the purpose of intimating his own
      presence, since what the French called the nom de guerre of the performer
      was described by the tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope will catch at the most feeble twig for support in extremity. I knew
      this man, though deprived of sight, to be bold, ingenious, and perfectly
      capable of acting as a guide. I believed I had won his goodwill, by
      having, in a frolic, assumed the character of his partner; and I
      remembered that in a wild, wandering, and disorderly course of life, men,
      as they become loosened from the ordinary bonds of civil society, hold
      those of comradeship more closely sacred; so that honour is sometimes
      found among thieves, and faith and attachment in such as the law has
      termed vagrants. The history of Richard Coeur de Lion and his minstrel,
      Blondel, rushed, at the same time, on my mind, though I could not even
      then suppress a smile at the dignity of the example when applied to a
      blind fiddler and myself. Still there was something in all this to awaken
      a hope that, if I could open a correspondence with this poor violer, he
      might be useful in extricating me from my present situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      His profession furnished me with some hope that this desired communication
      might be attained; since it is well known that, in Scotland, where there
      is so much national music, the words and airs of which are generally
      known, there is a kind of freemasonry amongst performers, by which they
      can, by the mere choice of a tune, express a great deal to the hearers.
      Personal allusions are often made in this manner, with much point and
      pleasantry; and nothing is more usual at public festivals, than that the
      air played to accompany a particular health or toast, is made the vehicle
      of compliment, of wit, and sometimes of satire. [Every one must remember
      instances of this festive custom, in which the adaptation of the tune to
      the toast was remarkably felicitous. Old Neil Gow, and his son Nathaniel,
      were peculiarly happy on such occasions.]
    </p>
    <p>
      While these things passed through my mind rapidly, I heard my friend
      beneath recommence, for the third time, the air from which his own name
      had been probably adopted, when he was interrupted by his rustic auditors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If thou canst play no other spring but that, mon, ho hadst best put up
      ho&rsquo;s pipes and be jogging. Squoire will be back anon, or Master Nixon, and
      we&rsquo;ll see who will pay poiper then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oho, thought I, if I have no sharper ears than those of my friends Jan and
      Dorcas to encounter, I may venture an experiment upon them; and, as most
      expressive of my state of captivity, I sang two or three lines of the
      137th Psalm&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  By Babel&rsquo;s streams we sat and wept.
</pre>
    <p>
      The country people listened with attention, and when I ceased, I heard
      them whisper together in tones of commiseration, &lsquo;Lack-a-day, poor soul!
      so pretty a man to be beside his wits!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An he be that gate,&rsquo; said Wandering Willie, in a tone calculated to reach
      my ears, &lsquo;I ken naething will raise his spirits like a spring.&rsquo; And he
      struck up, with great vigour and spirit, the lively Scottish air, the
      words of which instantly occurred to me&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Oh whistle and I&rsquo;ll come t&rsquo;ye, my lad,
  Oh whistle and I&rsquo;ll come t&rsquo;ye, my lad;
  Though father and mother and a&rsquo; should gae mad,
  Oh whistle and I&rsquo;ll come t&rsquo;ye, my lad.
</pre>
    <p>
      I soon heard a clattering noise of feet in the courtyard, which I
      concluded to be Jan and Dorcas dancing a jig in their Cumberland wooden
      clogs. Under cover of this din, I endeavoured to answer Willie&rsquo;s signal by
      whistling, as loud as I could&mdash;-
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Come back again and loe me
  When a&rsquo; the lave are gane.
</pre>
    <p>
      He instantly threw the dancers out, by changing his air to
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  There&rsquo;s my thumb, I&rsquo;ll ne&rsquo;er beguile thee.
</pre>
    <p>
      I no longer doubted that a communication betwixt us was happily
      established, and that, if I had an opportunity of speaking to the poor
      musician, I should find him willing to take my letter to the post, to
      invoke the assistance of some active magistrate, or of the
      commanding-officer of Carlisle Castle, or, in short, to do whatever else I
      could point out, in the compass of his power, to contribute to my
      liberation. But to obtain speech of him, I must have run the risk of
      alarming the suspicions of Dorcas, if not of her yet more stupid Corydon.
      My ally&rsquo;s blindness prevented his receiving any communication by signs
      from the window&mdash;even if I could have ventured to make them,
      consistently with prudence&mdash;so that notwithstanding the mode of
      intercourse we had adopted was both circuitous and peculiarly liable to
      misapprehension, I saw nothing I could do better than to continue it,
      trusting my own and my correspondent&rsquo;s acuteness in applying to the airs
      the meaning they were intended to convey. I thought of singing the words
      themselves of some significant song, but feared I might, by doing so,
      attract suspicion. I endeavoured, therefore, to intimate my speedy
      departure from my present place of residence, by whistling the well-known
      air with which festive parties in Scotland usually conclude the dance:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Good night and joy be wi&rsquo; ye a&rsquo;,
  For here nae langer maun I stay;
  There&rsquo;s neither friend nor foe, of mine
  But wishes that I were away.
</pre>
    <p>
      It appeared that Willie&rsquo;s powers of intelligence were much more active
      than mine, and that, like a deaf person accustomed to be spoken to by
      signs, he comprehended, from the very first notes, the whole meaning I
      intended to convey; and he accompanied me in the air with his violin, in
      such a manner as at once to show he understood my meaning, and to prevent
      my whistling from being attended to.
    </p>
    <p>
      His reply was almost immediate, and was conveyed in the old martial air of
      &lsquo;Hey, Johnnie lad, cock up your beaver.&rsquo; I ran over the words, and fixed
      on the following stanza, as most applicable to my circumstances:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Cock up your beaver, and cock it fu&rsquo; sprush;
  We&rsquo;ll over the Border and give them a brush;
  There&rsquo;s somebody there we&rsquo;ll teach better behaviour,
  Hey, Johnnie lad, cock up your beaver.
</pre>
    <p>
      If these sounds alluded, as I hope they do, to the chance of assistance
      from my Scottish friends, I may indeed consider that a door is open to
      hope and freedom. I immediately replied with:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  My heart&rsquo;s in the Highlands, my heart is not here;
  My heart&rsquo;s in the Highlands, a-chasing the deer;
  A-chasing the wild deer, and following the roe,
  My heart&rsquo;s in the Highlands wherever I go.

  Farewell to the Highlands!  farewell to the North!
  The birth-place of valour, the cradle of worth;
  Wherever I wander, wherever I rove,
  The hills of the Highlands for ever I love.
</pre>
    <p>
      Willie instantly played, with a degree of spirit which might have awakened
      hope in Despair herself, if Despair could be supposed to understand Scotch
      music, the fine old Jacobite air,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  For a&rsquo; that, and a&rsquo; that,
  And twice as much as a&rsquo; that.
</pre>
    <p>
      I next endeavoured to intimate my wish to send notice of my condition to
      my friends; and, despairing to find an air sufficiently expressive of my
      purpose, I ventured to sing a verse, which, in various forms, occurs so
      frequently in old ballads&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Whare will I get a bonny boy
  That will win hose and shoon:
  That will gae down to Durisdeer,
  And bid my merry men come?
</pre>
    <p>
      He drowned the latter part of the verse by playing, with much emphasis,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Kind Robin loes me.
</pre>
    <p>
      Of this, though I ran over the verses of the song in my mind, I could make
      nothing; and before I could contrive any mode of intimating my
      uncertainty, a cry arose in the courtyard that Cristal Nixon was coming.
      My faithful Willie was obliged to retreat; but not before he had half
      played, half hummed, by way of farewell,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Leave thee&mdash;leave thee, lad&mdash;
  I&rsquo;ll never leave thee;
  The stars shall gae withershins
  Ere I will leave thee.
</pre>
    <p>
      I am thus, I think, secure of one trusty adherent in my misfortunes; and,
      however whimsical it may be to rely much on a man of his idle profession
      and deprived of sight withal, it is deeply impressed on my mind that his
      services may be both useful and necessary. There is another quarter from
      which I look for succour, and which I have indicated to thee, Alan, in
      more than one passage of my journal. Twice, at the early hour of daybreak,
      I have seen the individual alluded to in the court of the farm, and twice
      she made signs of recognition in answer to the gestures by which I
      endeavoured to make her comprehend my situation; but on both occasions she
      pressed her finger on her lips, as expressive of silence and secrecy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The manner in which G.M. entered upon the scene for the first time, seems
      to assure me of her goodwill, so far as her power may reach; and I have
      many reasons to believe it is considerable. Yet she seemed hurried and
      frightened during the very transitory moments of our interview, and I
      think was, upon the last occasion, startled by the entrance of some one
      into the farmyard, just as she was on the point of addressing me. You must
      not ask whether I am an early riser, since such objects are only to be
      seen at daybreak; and although I have never again seen her, yet I have
      reason to think she is not distant. It was but three nights ago, that,
      worn out by the uniformity of my confinement, I had manifested more
      symptoms of despondence than I had before exhibited, which I conceive may
      have attracted the attention of the domestics, through whom the
      circumstance might transpire. On the next morning, the following lines lay
      on my table; but how conveyed there, I cannot tell. The hand in which they
      were written is a beautiful Italian manuscript:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  As lords their labourers&rsquo; hire delay,
  Fate quits our toil with hopes to come,
  Which, if far short of present pay,
  Still, owns a debt and names a sum.

  Quit not the pledge, frail sufferer, then,
  Although a distant date be given;
  Despair is treason towards man,
  And blasphemy to Heaven.
</pre>
    <p>
      That these lines were written with the friendly purpose of inducing me to
      keep up my spirits, I cannot doubt; and I trust the manner in which I
      shall conduct myself may show that the pledge is accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dress is arrived in which it seems to be my self-elected guardian&rsquo;s
      pleasure that I shall travel; and what does it prove to be?&mdash;A skirt,
      or upper-petticoat of camlet, like those worn by country ladies of
      moderate rank when on horseback, with such a riding-mask as they
      frequently use on journeys to preserve their eyes and complexion from the
      sun and dust, and sometimes, it is suspected, to enable then to play off a
      little coquetry. From the gayer mode of employing the mask, however, I
      suspect I shall be precluded; for instead of being only pasteboard,
      covered with black velvet, I observe with anxiety that mine is thickened
      with a plate of steel, which, like Quixote&rsquo;s visor, serves to render it
      more strong and durable.
    </p>
    <p>
      This apparatus, together with a steel clasp for securing the mask behind
      me with a padlock, gave me fearful recollections of the unfortunate being,
      who, never being permitted to lay aside such a visor, acquired the
      well-known historical epithet of the Man in the Iron Mask. I hesitated a
      moment whether I should, so far submit to the acts of oppression designed
      against me as to assume this disguise, which was, of course, contrived to
      aid their purposes. But when I remembered Mr. Herries&rsquo;s threat, that I
      should be kept close prisoner in a carriage, unless I assumed the dress
      which should be appointed for me; and I considered the comparative degree
      of freedom which I might purchase by wearing the mask and female dress as
      easily and advantageously purchased. Here, therefore, I must pause for the
      present, and await what the morning may bring forth.

      [To carry on the story from the documents before us, we think it proper
      here to drop the journal of the captive Darsie Latimer, and adopt,
      instead, a narrative of the proceedings of Alan Fairford in pursuit of his
      friend, which forms another series in this history.]

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <h3>
      NARRATIVE OF ALAN FAIRFORD
    </h3>
    <p>
      The reader ought, by this time, to have formed some idea of the character
      of Alan Fairford. He had a warmth of heart which the study of the law and
      of the world could not chill, and talents which they had rendered
      unusually acute. Deprived of the personal patronage enjoyed by most of his
      contemporaries, who assumed the gown under the protection of their
      aristocratic alliances and descents, he early saw that he should have that
      to achieve for himself which fell to them as a right of birth. He laboured
      hard in silence and solitude, and his labours were crowned with success.
      But Alan doted on his friend Darsie, even more than he loved his
      profession, and, as we have seen, threw everything aside when he thought
      Latimer in danger; forgetting fame and fortune, and hazarding even the
      serious displeasure of his father, to rescue him whom he loved with an
      elder brother&rsquo;s affection. Darsie, though his parts were more quick and
      brilliant than those of his friend, seemed always to the latter a being
      under his peculiar charge, whom he was called upon to cherish and protect
      in cases where the youth&rsquo;s own experience was unequal to the exigency; and
      now, when, the fate of Latimer seeming worse than doubtful, Alan&rsquo;s whole
      prudence and energy were to be exerted in his behalf, an adventure which
      might have seemed perilous to most youths of his age had no terrors for
      him. He was well acquainted with the laws of his country, and knew how to
      appeal to them; and, besides his professional confidence, his natural
      disposition was steady, sedate, persevering, and undaunted. With these
      requisites he undertook a quest which, at that time, was not unattended
      with actual danger, and had much in it to appal a more timid disposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fairford&rsquo;s first inquiry concerning his friend was of the chief magistrate
      of Dumfries, Provost Crosbie, who had sent the information of Darsie&rsquo;s
      disappearance. On his first application, he thought he discerned in the
      honest dignitary a desire to get rid of the subject. The provost spoke of
      the riot at the fishing station as an &lsquo;outbreak among those lawless loons
      the fishermen, which concerned the sheriff,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;more than us poor
      town council bodies, that have enough to do to keep peace within burgh,
      amongst such a set of commoners as the town are plagued with.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But this is not all, Provost Crosbie,&rsquo; said Mr. Alan Fairford; &lsquo;A young
      gentleman of rank and fortune has disappeared amongst their hands&mdash;you
      know him. My father gave him a letter to you&mdash;Mr. Darsie Latimer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lack-a-day, yes! lack-a-day, yes!&rsquo; said the provost; &lsquo;Mr. Darsie Latimer&mdash;he
      dined at my house&mdash;I hope he is well?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope so too,&rsquo; said Alan, rather indignantly; &lsquo;but I desire more
      certainty on that point. You yourself wrote my father that he had
      disappeared.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Troth, yes, and that is true,&rsquo; said the provost. &lsquo;But did he not go back
      to his friends in Scotland? it was not natural to think he would stay
      here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not unless he is under restraint,&rsquo; said Fairford, surprised at the
      coolness with which the provost seemed to take up the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rely on it, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Crosbie, &lsquo;that if he has not returned to his
      friends in Scotland, he must have gone to his friends in England.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will rely on no such thing,&rsquo; said Alan; &lsquo;if there is law or justice in
      Scotland, I will have the thing cleared to the very bottom.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Reasonable, reasonable,&rsquo; said the provost, &lsquo;so far as is possible; but
      you know I have no power beyond the ports of the burgh.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you are in the commission besides, Mr. Crosbie; a justice of peace
      for the county.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;True, very true&mdash;that is,&rsquo; said the cautious magistrate, &lsquo;I will not
      say but my name may stand on the list, but I cannot remember that I have
      ever qualified.&rsquo; [By taking the oaths to government.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, in that case,&rsquo; said young Fairford, &lsquo;there are ill-natured people
      might doubt your attachment to the Protestant line, Mr. Crosbie.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God forbid, Mr. Fairford! I who have done and suffered in the Forty-five.
      I reckon the Highlandmen did me damage to the amount of 100l. Scots, forby
      all they ate and drank&mdash;no, no, sir, I stand beyond challenge; but as
      for plaguing myself with county business, let them that aught the mare
      shoe the mare. The commissioners of supply would see my back broken before
      they would help me in the burgh&rsquo;s work, and all the world kens the
      difference of the weight between public business in burgh and landward.
      What are their riots to me? have we not riots enough of our own?&mdash;But
      I must be getting ready, for the council meets this forenoon. I am blithe
      to see your father&rsquo;s son on the causeway of our ancient burgh, Mr. Alan
      Fairford. Were you a twelve-month aulder, we would make a burgess of you,
      man. I hope you will come and dine with me before you go away. What think
      you of to-day at two o&rsquo;clock&mdash;just a roasted chucky and a drappit
      egg?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan Fairford resolved that his friend&rsquo;s hospitality should not, as it
      seemed the inviter intended, put a stop to his queries. &lsquo;I must delay you
      for a moment,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;Mr. Crosbie; this is a serious affair; a young
      gentleman of high hopes, my own dearest friend, is missing&mdash;you
      cannot think it will be passed over slightly, if a man of your high
      character and known zeal for the government do not make some active
      inquiry. Mr. Crosbie, you are my father&rsquo;s friend, and I respect you as
      such&mdash;but to others it will have a bad appearance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The withers of the provost were not unwrung; he paced the room in much
      tribulation, repeating, &lsquo;But what can I do, Mr. Fairford? I warrant your
      friend casts up again&mdash;he will come back again, like the ill shilling&mdash;he
      is not the sort of gear that tynes&mdash;a hellicat boy, running through
      the country with a blind fiddler and playing the fiddle to a parcel of
      blackguards, who can tell where the like of him may have scampered to?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There are persons apprehended, and in the jail of the town, as I
      understand from the sheriff-substitute,&rsquo; said Mr. Fairford; &lsquo;you must call
      them before you, and inquire what they know of this young gentleman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, aye&mdash;the sheriff-depute did commit some poor creatures, I
      believe&mdash;wretched ignorant fishermen bodies, that had been
      quarrelling with Quaker Geddes and his stake-nets, whilk, under favour of
      your gown be it spoken, Mr. Fairford, are not over and above lawful, and
      the town clerk thinks that they may be lawfully removed VIA FACTI&mdash;but
      that is by the by. But, sir, the creatures were a&rsquo; dismissed for want of
      evidence; the Quaker would not swear to them, and what could the sheriff
      and me do but just let them loose? Come awa, cheer up, Master Alan, and
      take a walk till dinner-time&mdash;I must really go to the council.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop a moment, provost,&rsquo; said Alan; &lsquo;I lodge a complaint before you as a
      magistrate, and you will find it serious to slight it over. You must have
      these men apprehended again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, aye&mdash;easy said; but catch them that can,&rsquo; answered the provost;
      &lsquo;they are ower the march by this time, or by the point of Cairn.&mdash;Lord
      help ye! they are a kind of amphibious deevils, neither land nor water
      beasts neither English nor Scots&mdash;neither county nor stewartry, as we
      say&mdash;they are dispersed like so much quicksilver. You may as well try
      to whistle a sealgh out of the Solway, as to get hold of one of them till
      all the fray is over.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Crosbie, this will not do,&rsquo; answered the young counsellor; &lsquo;there is
      a person of more importance than such wretches as you describe concerned
      in this unhappy business&mdash;I must name to you a certain Mr. Herries.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept his eye on the provost as he uttered the name, which he did rather
      at a venture, and from the connexion which that gentleman, and his real or
      supposed niece, seemed to have with the fate of Darsie Latimer, than from
      any distinct cause of suspicion which he entertained. He thought the
      provost seemed embarrassed, though he showed much desire to assume an
      appearance of indifference, in which he partly succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Herries!&rsquo; he said&mdash;&lsquo;What Herries?&mdash;There are many of that name&mdash;not
      so many as formerly, for the old stocks are wearing out; but there is
      Herries of Heathgill, and Herries of Auchintulloch, and Herries&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To save you further trouble, this person&rsquo;s designation is Herries of
      Birrenswork.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of Birrenswork?&rsquo; said Mr. Crosbie; &lsquo;I have you now, Mr. Alan. Could you
      not as well have said, the Laird of Redgauntlet?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fairford was too wary to testify any surprise at this identification of
      names, however unexpected. &lsquo;I thought,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;he was more generally
      known by the name of Herries. I have seen and been in company with him
      under that name, I am sure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh aye; in Edinburgh, belike. You know Redgauntlet was unfortunate a
      great while ago, and though he was maybe not deeper in the mire than other
      folk, yet, for some reason or other, he did not get so easily out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was attainted, I understand; and has no remission,&rsquo; said Fairford.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cautious provost only nodded, and said, &lsquo;You may guess, therefore, why
      it is so convenient he should hold his mother&rsquo;s name, which is also partly
      his own, when he is about Edinburgh. To bear his proper name might be
      accounted a kind of flying in the face of government, ye understand. But
      he has been long connived at&mdash;the story is an old story&mdash;and the
      gentleman has many excellent qualities, and is of a very ancient and
      honourable house&mdash;has cousins among the great folk&mdash;counts kin
      with the advocate and with the sheriff&mdash;hawks, you know, Mr. Alan,
      will not pike out hawks&rsquo; een&mdash;he is widely connected&mdash;my wife is
      a fourth cousin of Redgauntlet&rsquo;s.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      HINC ILLAE LACHRYMAE! thought Alan Fairford to himself; but the hint
      presently determined him to proceed by soft means and with caution. &lsquo;I beg
      you to understand,&rsquo; said Fairford, &lsquo;that in the investigation I am about
      to make, I design no harm to Mr. Herries, or Redgauntlet&mdash;call him
      what you will. All I wish is, to ascertain the safety of my friend. I know
      that he was rather foolish in once going upon a mere frolic, in disguise,
      to the neighbourhood of this same gentleman&rsquo;s house. In his circumstances,
      Mr. Redgauntlet may have misinterpreted the motives, and considered Darsie
      Latimer as a spy. His influence, I believe, is great among the disorderly
      people you spoke of but now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The provost answered with another sagacious shake of his head, that would
      have done honour to Lord Burleigh in the CRITIC.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; continued Fairford,&rsquo; is it not possible that, in the
      mistaken belief that Mr. Latimer was a spy, he may, upon such suspicion,
      have caused him to be carried off and confined somewhere? Such things are
      done at elections, and on occasions less pressing than when men think
      their lives are in danger from an informer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Fairford,&rsquo; said the provost, very earnestly, &lsquo;I scarce think such a
      mistake possible; or if, by any extraordinary chance, it should have taken
      place, Redgauntlet, whom I cannot but know well, being as I have said my
      wife&rsquo;s first cousin (fourth cousin, I should say) is altogether incapable
      of doing anything harsh to the young gentleman&mdash;he might send him
      ower to Ailsay for a night or two, or maybe land him on the north coast of
      Ireland, or in Islay, or some of the Hebrides; but depend upon it, he is
      incapable of harming a hair of his head.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am determined not to trust to that, provost,&rsquo; answered Fairford firmly;
      &lsquo;and I am a good deal surprised at your way of talking so lightly of such
      an aggression on the liberty of the subject. You are to consider, and Mr.
      Herries or Mr. Redgauntlet&rsquo;s friends would do very well also to consider,
      how it would sound in the ears of an English Secretary of State, that an
      attainted traitor (for such is this gentleman) has not only ventured to
      take up his abode in this realm&mdash;against the king of which he has
      been in arms&mdash;but is suspected of having proceeded, by open force and
      violence, against the person of one of the lieges, a young man who is
      neither without friends nor property to secure his being righted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The provost looked at the young counsellor with a face in which distrust,
      alarm, and vexation seemed mingled. &lsquo;A fashious job,&rsquo; he said at last, &lsquo;a
      fashious job; and it will be dangerous meddling with it. I should like ill
      to see your father&rsquo;s son turn informer against an unfortunate gentleman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Neither do I mean it,&rsquo; answered Alan, &lsquo;provided that unfortunate
      gentleman and his friends give me a quiet opportunity of securing my
      friend&rsquo;s safety. If I could speak with Mr. Redgauntlet, and hear his own
      explanation, I should probably be satisfied. If I am forced, to denounce
      him to government, it will be in his new capacity of a kidnapper. I may
      not be able, nor is it my business, to prevent his being recognized in his
      former character of an attainted person, excepted from the general
      pardon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Master Fairford,&rsquo; said the provost, &lsquo;would ye ruin the poor innocent
      gentleman on an idle suspicion?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Say no more of it, Mr. Crosbie; my line of conduct is determined&mdash;unless
      that suspicion is removed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Weel, sir,&rsquo; said the provost, &lsquo;since so it be, and since you say that you
      do not seek to harm Redgauntlet personally, I&rsquo;ll ask a man to dine with us
      to-day that kens as much about his matters as most folk. You must think,
      Mr. Alan Fairford, though Redgauntlet be my wife&rsquo;s near relative, and
      though, doubtless, I wish him weel, yet I am not the person who is like to
      be intrusted with his incomings and outgoings. I am not a man for that&mdash;I
      keep the kirk, and I abhor Popery&mdash;I have stood up for the House of
      Hanover, and for liberty and property&mdash;I carried arms, sir, against
      the Pretender, when three of the Highlandmen&rsquo;s baggage-carts were stopped
      at Ecclefechan; and I had an especial loss of a hundred pounds&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Scots,&rsquo; interrupted Fairford. &lsquo;You forget you told me all this before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Scots or English, it was too much for me to lose,&rsquo; said the provost; so
      you see I am not a person to pack or peel with Jacobites, and such
      unfreemen as poor Redgauntlet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Granted, granted, Mr. Crosbie; and what then?&rsquo; said Alan Fairford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, then, it follows, that if I am to help you at this pinch, if cannot
      be by and through my ain personal knowledge, but through some fitting
      agent or third person.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Granted again,&rsquo; said Fairford. &lsquo;And pray who may this third person be?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wha but Pate Maxwell of Summertrees&mdash;him they call Pate-in-Peril.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An old Forty-five man, of course?&rsquo; said Fairford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ye may swear that,&rsquo; replied the provost&mdash;&lsquo;as black a Jacobite as the
      auld leaven can make him; but a sonsy, merry companion, that none of us
      think it worth while to break wi&rsquo; for all his brags and his clavers. You
      would have thought, if he had had but his own way at Derby, he would have
      marched Charlie Stuart through between Wade and the Duke, as a thread goes
      through the needle&rsquo;s ee, and seated him in Saint James&rsquo;s before you could
      have said haud your hand. But though he is a windy body when he gets on
      his auld-warld stories, he has mair gumption in him than most people&mdash;knows
      business, Mr. Alan, being bred to the law; but never took the gown,
      because of the oaths, which kept more folk out then than they do now&mdash;the
      more&rsquo;s the pity.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What! are you sorry, provost, that Jacobitism is upon the decline?&rsquo; said
      Fairford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; answered the provost&mdash;&lsquo;I am only sorry for folks losing the
      tenderness of conscience which they used to have. I have a son breeding to
      the bar, Mr. Fairford; and, no doubt, considering my services and
      sufferings, I might have looked for some bit postie to him; but if the
      muckle tykes come in&mdash;I mean a&rsquo; these Maxwells, and Johnstones, and
      great lairds, that the oaths used to keep out lang syne&mdash;the bits o&rsquo; 
      messan doggies, like my son, and maybe like your father&rsquo;s son, Mr. Alan,
      will be sair put to the wall.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But to return to the subject, Mr. Crosbie,&rsquo; said Fairford, &lsquo;do you really
      think it likely that this Mr. Maxwell will be of service in this matter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s very like he may be, for he is the tongue of the trump to the whole
      squad of them,&rsquo; said the provost; &lsquo;and Redgauntlet, though he will not
      stick at times to call him a fool, takes more of his counsel than any
      man&rsquo;s else that I am aware of. If Fate can bring him to a communing, the
      business is done. He&rsquo;s a sharp chield, Pate-in-Peril.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pate-in-Peril!&rsquo; repeated Alan; &lsquo;a very singular name.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, and it was in as queer a way he got it; but I&rsquo;ll say naething about
      that,&rsquo; said the provost, &lsquo;for fear of forestalling his market; for ye are
      sure to hear it once at least, however oftener, before the punch-bowl
      gives place to the teapot.&mdash;And now, fare ye weel; for there is the
      council-bell clinking in earnest; and if I am not there before it jows in,
      Bailie Laurie will be trying some of his manoeuvres.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The provost, repeating his expectation of seeing Mr. Fairford at two
      o&rsquo;clock, at length effected his escape from the young counsellor, and left
      him at a considerable loss how to proceed. The sheriff, it seems, had
      returned to Edinburgh, and he feared to find the visible repugnance of the
      provost to interfere with this Laird of Birrenswork, or Redgauntlet, much
      stronger amongst the country gentlemen, many of whom were Catholics as
      well as Jacobites, and most others unwilling to quarrel with kinsmen and
      friends, by prosecuting with severity political offences which had almost
      run a prescription.
    </p>
    <p>
      To collect all the information in his power, and not to have recourse to
      the higher authorities until he could give all the light of which the case
      was capable, seemed the wiser proceeding in a choice of difficulties. He
      had some conversation with the procurator-fiscal, who, as well as the
      provost, was an old correspondent of his father. Alan expressed to that
      officer a purpose of visiting Brokenburn, but was assured by him, that it
      would be a step attended with much danger to his own person, and
      altogether fruitless; that the individuals who had been ringleaders in the
      riot were long since safely sheltered in their various lurking-holes in
      the Isle of Man, Cumberland, and elsewhere; and that those who might
      remain would undoubtedly commit violence on any who visited their
      settlement with the purpose of inquiring into the late disturbances.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were not the same objections to his hastening to Mount Sharon, where
      he expected to find the latest news of his friend; and there was time
      enough to do so, before the hour appointed for the provost&rsquo;s dinner. Upon
      the road, he congratulated himself on having obtained one point of almost
      certain information. The person who had in a manner forced himself upon
      his father&rsquo;s hospitality, and had appeared desirous to induce Darsie
      Latimer to visit England, against whom, too, a sort of warning had been
      received from an individual connected with and residing in his own family,
      proved to be a promoter of the disturbance in which Darsie had
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could be the cause of such an attempt on the liberty of an
      inoffensive and amiable man? It was impossible it could be merely owing to
      Redgauntlet&rsquo;s mistaking Darsie for a spy; for though that was the solution
      which Fairford had offered to the provost, he well knew that, in point of
      fact, he himself had been warned by his singular visitor of some danger to
      which his friend was exposed, before such suspicion could have been
      entertained; and the injunctions received by Latimer from his guardian, or
      him who acted as such, Mr. Griffiths of London, pointed to the same thing.
      He was rather glad, however, that he had not let Provost Crosbie into his
      secret further than was absolutely necessary; since it was plain that the
      connexion of his wife with the suspected party was likely to affect his
      impartiality as a magistrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Alan Fairford arrived at Mount Sharon, Rachel Geddes hastened to meet
      him, almost before the servant could open the door. She drew back in
      disappointment when she beheld a stranger, and said, to excuse her
      precipitation, that &lsquo;she had thought it was her brother Joshua returned
      from Cumberland.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Geddes is then absent from home?&rsquo; said Fairford, much disappointed in
      his turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He hath been gone since yesterday, friend,&rsquo; answered Rachel, once more
      composed to the quietude which characterizes her sect, but her pale cheek
      and red eye giving contradiction to her assumed equanimity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am,&rsquo; said Fairford, hastily, &lsquo;the particular friend of a young man not
      unknown to you, Miss Geddes&mdash;the friend of Darsie Latimer&mdash;and
      am come hither in the utmost anxiety, having understood from Provost
      Crosbie, that he had disappeared in the night when a destructive attack
      was made upon the fishing-station of Mr. Geddes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thou dost afflict me, friend, by thy inquiries,&rsquo; said Rachel, more
      affected than before; &lsquo;for although the youth was like those of the
      worldly generation, wise in his own conceit, and lightly to be moved by
      the breath of vanity, yet Joshua loved him, and his heart clave to him as
      if he had been his own son. And when he himself escaped from the sons of
      Belial, which was not until they had tired themselves with reviling, and
      with idle reproach, and the jests of the scoffer, Joshua, my brother,
      returned to them once and again, to give ransom for the youth called
      Darsie Latimer, with offers of money and with promise of remission, but
      they would not hearken to him. Also, he went before the head judge, whom
      men call the sheriff, and would have told him of the youth&rsquo;s peril; but he
      would in no way hearken to him unless he would swear unto the truth of his
      words, which thing he might not do without sin, seeing it is written,
      Swear not at all&mdash;also, that our conversation shall be yea or nay.
      Therefore, Joshua returned to me disconsolate, and said, &ldquo;Sister Rachel,
      this youth hath run into peril for my sake; assuredly I shall not be
      guiltless if a hair of his head be harmed, seeing I have sinned in
      permitting him to go with me to the fishing station when such evil was to
      be feared. Therefore, I will take my horse, even Solomon, and ride swiftly
      into Cumberland, and I will make myself friends with Mammon of
      Unrighteousness, among the magistrates of the Gentiles, and among their
      mighty men; and it shall come to pass that Darsie Latimer shall be
      delivered, even if it were at the expense of half my substance.&rdquo; And I
      said, &ldquo;Nay, my brother, go not, for they will but scoff at and revile
      thee; but hire with thy silver one of the scribes, who are eager as
      hunters in pursuing their prey, and he shall free Darsie Latimer from the
      men of violence by his cunning, and thy soul shall be guiltless of evil
      towards the lad.&rdquo; But he answered and said, &ldquo;I will not be controlled in
      this matter.&rdquo; And he is gone forth and hath not returned, and I fear me
      that he may never return; for though he be peaceful, as becometh one who
      holds all violence as offence against his own soul, yet neither the floods
      of water, nor the fear of the snare, nor the drawn sword of the adversary
      brandished in the path, will overcome his purpose. Wherefore the Solway
      may swallow him up, or the sword of the enemy may devour him&mdash;nevertheless,
      my hope is better in Him who directeth all things, and ruleth over the
      waves of the sea, and overruleth the devices of the wicked, and who can
      redeem us even as a bird from the fowler&rsquo;s net.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was all that Fairford could learn from Miss Geddes; but he heard with
      pleasure that the good Quaker, her brother, had many friends among those
      of his own profession in Cumberland, and without exposing himself to so
      much danger as his sister seemed to apprehend, he trusted he might be able
      to discover some traces of Darsie Latimer. He himself rode back to
      Dumfries, having left with Miss Geddes his direction in that place, and an
      earnest request that she would forward thither whatever information she
      might obtain from her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Fairford&rsquo;s return to Dumfries, he employed the brief interval which
      remained before dinner-time, in writing an account of what had befallen
      Latimer and of the present uncertainty of his condition, to Mr. Samuel
      Griffiths, through whose hands the remittances for his friend&rsquo;s service
      had been regularly made, desiring he would instantly acquaint him with
      such parts of his history as might direct him in the search which he was
      about to institute through the border counties, and which he pledged
      himself not; to give up until he had obtained news of his friend, alive or
      dead, The young lawyer&rsquo;s mind felt easier when he had dispatched this
      letter. He could not conceive any reason why his friend&rsquo;s life should be
      aimed at; he knew Darsie had done nothing by which his liberty could be
      legally affected; and although, even of late years, there had been
      singular histories of men, and women also, who had been trepanned, and
      concealed in solitudes and distant islands in order to serve some
      temporary purpose, such violences had been chiefly practised by the rich
      on the poor, and by the strong on the feeble; whereas, in the present
      case, this Mr. Herries, or Redgauntlet, being amenable, for more reasons
      than one, to the censure of the law, must be the weakest in any struggle
      in which it could be appealed to. It is true, that his friendly anxiety
      whispered that the very cause which rendered this oppressor less
      formidable, might make him more desperate. Still, recalling his language,
      so strikingly that of the gentleman, and even of the man of honour, Alan
      Fairford concluded, that though, in his feudal pride, Redgauntlet might
      venture on the deeds of violence exercised by the aristocracy in other
      times, he could not be capable of any action of deliberate atrocity. And
      in these convictions he went to dine with Provost Crosbie, with a heart
      more at ease than might have been expected. [See Note 7.]

      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      NARRATIVE OF ALAN FAIRFORD, CONTINUED
    </h3>
    <p>
      Five minutes had elapsed after the town clock struck two, before Alan
      Fairford, who had made a small detour to put his letter into the
      post-house, reached the mansion of Mr. Provost Crosbie, and was at once
      greeted by the voice of that civic dignitary, and the rural dignitary his
      visitor, as by the voices of men impatient for their dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come away, Mr. Fairford&mdash;the Edinburgh time is later than ours,&rsquo; 
      said the provost.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, &lsquo;Come away, young gentleman,&rsquo; said the laird; &lsquo;I remember your father
      weel at the Cross thirty years ago&mdash;I reckon you are as late in
      Edinburgh as at London, four o&rsquo;clock hours&mdash;eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not quite so degenerate,&rsquo; replied Fairford; &lsquo;but certainly many Edinburgh
      people are so ill-advised as to postpone their dinner till three, that
      they may have full time to answer their London correspondents.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;London correspondents!&rsquo; said Mr. Maxwell; &lsquo;and pray what the devil have
      the people of Auld Reekie to do with London correspondents?&rsquo; [Not much in
      those days, for within my recollection the London post; was brought north
      in a small mail-cart; and men are yet as live who recollect when it came
      down with only one single letter for Edinburgh, addressed to the manager
      of the British Linen Company.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The tradesmen must have their goods,&rsquo; said Fairford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can they not buy our own Scottish manufactures, and pick their customers
      pockets in a more patriotic manner?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then the ladies must have fashions,&rsquo; said Fairford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can they not busk the plaid over their heads, as their mothers did? A
      tartan screen, and once a year a new cockernony from Paris, should serve a
      countess. But ye have not many of them left, I think&mdash;Mareschal,
      Airley, Winton, Vemyss, Balmerino, all passed and gone&mdash;aye, aye, the
      countesses and ladies of quality will scarce take up too much of your
      ball-room floor with their quality hoops nowadays.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is no want of crowding, however, sir,&rsquo; said Fairford; &lsquo;they begin
      to talk of a new Assembly room.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A new Assembly room!&rsquo; said the old Jacobite laird&mdash;&lsquo;Umph&mdash;I
      mind quartering three hundred men in the old Assembly room [I remember
      hearing this identical answer given by an old Highland gentleman of the
      Forty-Five, when he heard of the opening of the New Assembly Rooms in
      George Street.]&mdash;But come, come&mdash;I&rsquo;ll ask no more questions&mdash;the
      answers all smell of new lords new lands, and do but spoil my appetite,
      which were a pity, since here comes Mrs. Crosbie to say our mutton&rsquo;s
      ready.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was even so. Mrs. Crosbie had been absent, like Eve, &lsquo;on hospitable
      cares intent,&rsquo; a duty which she did not conceive herself exempted from,
      either by the dignity of her husband&rsquo;s rank in the municipality, or the
      splendour of her Brussels silk gown, or even by the more highly prized
      lustre of her birth; for she was born a Maxwell, and allied, as her
      husband often informed his friends, to several of the first families in
      the county. She had been handsome, and was still a portly, good-looking
      woman of her years; and though her peep into the kitchen had somewhat
      heightened her complexion, it was no more than a modest touch of rouge
      might have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      The provost was certainly proud of his lady, nay, some said he was afraid
      of her; for of the females of the Redgauntlet family there went a rumour,
      that, ally where they would, there was a grey mare as surely in the
      stables of their husbands, as there is a white horse in Wouvermans&rsquo; 
      pictures. The good dame, too, was supposed to have brought a spice of
      politics into Mr. Crosbie&rsquo;s household along with her; and the provost&rsquo;s
      enemies at the council-table of the burgh used to observe that he uttered
      there many a bold harangue against the Pretender, and in favour of King
      George and government, of which he dared not have pronounced a syllable in
      his own bedchamber; and that, in fact, his wife&rsquo;s predominating influence
      had now and then occasioned his acting, or forbearing to act, in a manner
      very different from his general professions of zeal for Revolution
      principles. If this was in any respect true, it was certain, on the other
      hand, that Mrs. Crosbie, in all external points, seemed to acknowledge the
      &lsquo;lawful sway and right supremacy&rsquo; of the head of the house, and if she did
      not in truth reverence her husband, she at least seemed to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      This stately dame received Mr. Maxwell (a cousin of course) with
      cordiality, and Fairford with civility; answering at the same time with
      respect, to the magisterial complaints of the provost, that dinner was
      just coming up. &lsquo;But since you changed poor Peter MacAlpin, that used to
      take care of the town-clock, my dear, it has never gone well a single
      day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Peter MacAlpin, my dear,&rsquo; said the provost,&rsquo; made himself too busy for a
      person in office, and drunk healths and so forth, which it became no man
      to drink or to pledge, far less one that is in point of office a servant
      of the public, I understand that he lost the music bells in Edinburgh, for
      playing &ldquo;Ower the Water to Charlie,&rdquo; upon the tenth of June. He is a black
      sheep, and deserves no encouragement.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a bad tune though, after all,&rsquo; said Summertrees; and, turning to the
      window, he half hummed, half whistled, the air in question, then sang the
      last verse aloud:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;Oh I loe weel my Charlie&rsquo;s name,
    Though some there be that abhor him;
   But oh to see the deil gang hame
    Wi&rsquo; a&rsquo; the Whigs before him!
   Over the water, and over the sea,
    And over the water to Charlie;
   Come weal, come woe, we&rsquo;ll gather and go,
    And live or die with Charlie.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crosbie smiled furtively on the laird, wearing an aspect at the same
      time of deep submission; while the provost, not choosing to hear his
      visitor&rsquo;s ditty, took a turn through the room, in unquestioned dignity and
      independence of authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aweel, aweel, my dear,&rsquo; said the lady, with a quiet smile of submission,
      &lsquo;ye ken these matters best, and you will do your pleasure&mdash;they are
      far above my hand&mdash;only, I doubt if ever the town-clock will go
      right, or your meals be got up so regular as I should wish, till Peter
      MacAlpin gets his office back again. The body&rsquo;s auld, and can neither work
      nor want, but he is the only hand to set a clock.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be noticed in passing, that notwithstanding this prediction, which,
      probably, the fair Cassandra had the full means of accomplishing, it was
      not till the second council day thereafter that the misdemeanours of the
      Jacobite clock-keeper were passed over, and he was once more restored to
      his occupation of fixing the town&rsquo;s time, and the provost&rsquo;s dinner-hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the present occasion the dinner passed pleasantly away. Summertrees
      talked and jested with the easy indifference of a man who holds himself
      superior to his company. He was indeed an important person, as was
      testified by his portly appearance; his hat laced with POINT D&rsquo;ESPAGNE;
      his coat and waistcoat once richly embroidered, though now almost
      threadbare; the splendour of his solitaire, and laced ruffles, though the
      first was sorely creased, and the other sullied; not to forget the length
      of his silver-hilted rapier. His wit, or rather humour, bordered on the
      sarcastic, and intimated a discontented man; and although he showed no
      displeasure when the provost attempted a repartee, yet it seemed that he
      permitted it upon mere sufferance, as a fencing-master, engaged with a
      pupil, will sometimes permit the tyro to hit him, solely by way of
      encouragement. The laird&rsquo;s own jests, in the meanwhile, were eminently
      successful, not only with the provost and his lady, but with the
      red-cheeked and red-ribboned servant-maid who waited at table, and who
      could scarce perform her duty with propriety, so effectual were the
      explosions of Summertrees. Alan Fairford alone was unmoved among all this
      mirth; which was the less wonderful, that, besides the important subject
      which occupied his thoughts, most of the laird&rsquo;s good things consisted in
      sly allusions to little parochial or family incidents, with which the
      Edinburgh visitor was totally unacquainted: so that the laughter of the
      party sounded in his ear like the idle crackling of thorns under the pot,
      with this difference, that they did not accompany or second any such
      useful operation as the boiling thereof.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fairford was glad when the cloth was withdrawn; and when Provost Crosbie
      (not without some points of advice from his lady touching the precise
      mixture of the ingredients) had accomplished the compounding of a noble
      bowl of punch, at which the old Jacobite&rsquo;s eyes seemed to glisten, the
      glasses were pushed round it, filled, and withdrawn each by its owner,
      when the provost emphatically named the toast, &lsquo;The King,&rsquo; with an
      important look to Fairford, which seemed to say, You can have no doubt
      whom I mean, and therefore there is no occasion to particularize the
      individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Summertrees repeated the toast, with a sly wink to the lady, while
      Fairford drank his glass in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, young advocate,&rsquo; said the landed proprietor, &lsquo;I am glad to see
      there is some shame, if there is little honesty, left in the Faculty. Some
      of your black gowns, nowadays, have as little of the one as of the other.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At least, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Fairford, &lsquo;I am so much of a lawyer as not
      willingly to enter into disputes which I am not retained to support&mdash;it
      would be but throwing away both time and argument.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, come,&rsquo; said the lady, &lsquo;we will have no argument in this house about
      Whig or Tory&mdash;the provost kens what he maun SAY, and I ken what he
      should THINK; and for a&rsquo; that has come and gane yet, there may be a time
      coming when honest men may say what they think, whether they be provosts
      or not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;D&rsquo;ye hear that, provost?&rsquo; said Summertrees; &lsquo;your wife&rsquo;s a witch, man;
      you should nail a horseshoe on your chamber door&mdash;Ha, ha, ha!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This sally did not take quite so well as former efforts of the laird&rsquo;s
      wit. The lady drew up, and the provost said, half aside, &lsquo;The sooth bourd
      is nae bourd. [The true joke is no joke.] You will find the horseshoe
      hissing hot, Summertrees.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can speak from experience, doubtless, provost,&rsquo; answered the laird;
      &lsquo;but I crave pardon&mdash;I need not tell Mrs. Crosbie that I have all
      respect for the auld and honourable House of Redgauntlet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And good reason ye have, that are sae sib to them,&rsquo; quoth the lady, &lsquo;and
      kend weel baith them that are here, and them that are gane.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In troth, and ye may say sae, madam,&rsquo; answered the laird; &lsquo;for poor Harry
      Redgauntlet, that suffered at Carlisle, was hand and glove with me; and
      yet we parted on short leave-taking.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, Summertrees,&rsquo; said the provost; &lsquo;that was when you played
      Cheat-the-woodie, and gat the by-name of Pate-in-Peril. I wish you would
      tell the story to my young friend here. He likes weel to hear of a sharp
      trick, as most lawyers do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder at your want of circumspection, provost,&rsquo; said the laird,&mdash;much
      after the manner of a singer when declining to sing the song that is
      quivering upon his tongue&rsquo;s very end. &lsquo;Ye should mind there are some auld
      stories that cannot be ripped up again with entire safety to all
      concerned. TACE is Latin for a candle,&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope,&rsquo; said the lady, &lsquo;you are not afraid of anything being said out of
      this house to your prejudice, Summertrees? I have heard the story before;
      but the oftener I hear it, the more wonderful I think it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, madam; but it has been now a wonder of more than nine days, and it
      is time it should be ended,&rsquo; answered Maxwell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fairford now thought it civil to say, &lsquo;that he had often heard of Mr.
      Maxwell&rsquo;s wonderful escape, and that nothing could be more agreeable to
      him than to hear the right version of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Summertrees was obdurate, and refused to take up the time of the
      company with such &lsquo;auld-warld nonsense.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Weel, weel,&rsquo; said the provost, &lsquo;a wilful man maun hae his way. What do
      your folk in the country think about the disturbances that are beginning
      to spunk out in the colonies?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Excellent, sir, excellent. When things come to the worst; they will mend;
      and to the worst they are coming. But as to that nonsense ploy of mine, if
      ye insist on hearing the particulars,&rsquo;&mdash;said the laird, who began to
      be sensible that the period of telling his story gracefully was gliding
      fast away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said the provost, &lsquo;it was not for myself, but this young
      gentlemen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aweel, what for should I not pleasure the young gentlemen? I&rsquo;ll just
      drink to honest folk at hame and abroad, and deil ane else. And then&mdash;but
      you have heard it before, Mrs. Crosbie?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not so often as to think it tiresome, I assure ye,&rsquo; said the lady; and
      without further preliminaries, the laird addressed Alan Fairford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ye have heard of a year they call the FORTY-FIVE, young gentleman; when
      the Southrons&rsquo; heads made their last acquaintance with Scottish claymores?
      There was a set of rampauging chields in the country then that they called
      rebels&mdash;I never could find out what for&mdash;Some men should have
      been wi&rsquo; them that never came, provost&mdash;Skye and the Bush aboon
      Traquair for that, ye ken.&mdash;Weel, the job was settled at last.
      Cloured crowns were plenty, and raxed necks came into fashion. I dinna
      mind very weel what I was doing, swaggering about the country with dirk
      and pistol at my belt for five or six months, or thereaway; but I had a
      weary waking out of a wild dream. When did I find myself on foot in a
      misty morning, with my hand, just for fear of going astray, linked into a
      handcuff, as they call it, with poor Harry Redgauntlet&rsquo;s fastened into the
      other; and there we were, trudging along, with about a score more that had
      thrust their horns ower deep in the bog, just like ourselves, and a
      sergeant&rsquo;s guard of redcoats, with twa file of dragoons, to keep all
      quiet, and give us heart to the road. Now, if this mode of travelling was
      not very pleasant, the object did not particularly recommend it; for, you
      understand, young man, that they did not trust these poor rebel bodies to
      be tried by juries of their ain kindly countrymen, though ane would have
      thought they would have found Whigs enough in Scotland to hang us all; but
      they behoved to trounce us away to be tried at Carlisle, where the folk
      had been so frightened, that had you brought a whole Highland clan at once
      into the court, they would have put their hands upon their een, and cried,
      &ldquo;hang them a&rsquo;,&rdquo; just to be quit of them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, aye,&rsquo; said the provost, &lsquo;that was a snell law, I grant ye.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Snell!&rsquo; said the wife, &lsquo;snell! I wish they that passed it had the jury I
      would recommend them to!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose the young lawyer thinks it all very right,&rsquo; said Summertrees,
      looking at Fairford&mdash;&lsquo;an OLD lawyer might have thought otherwise.
      However, the cudgel was to be found to beat the dog, and they chose a
      heavy one. Well, I kept my spirits better than my companion, poor fellow;
      for I had the luck to have neither wife nor child to think about, and
      Harry Redgauntlet had both one and t&rsquo;other.&mdash;You have seen Harry,
      Mrs. Crosbie?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In troth have I,&rsquo; said she, with the sigh which we give to early
      recollections, of which the object is no more. &lsquo;He was not so tall as his
      brother, and a gentler lad every way. After he married the great English
      fortune, folk called him less of a Scottishman than Edward.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Folk lee&rsquo;d, then,&rsquo; said Summertrees; &lsquo;poor Harry was none of your
      bold-speaking, ranting reivers, that talk about what they did yesterday,
      or what they will do to-morrow; it was when something was to do at the
      moment that you should have looked at Harry Redgauntlet. I saw him at
      Culloden, when all was lost, doing more than twenty of these bleezing
      braggarts, till the very soldiers that took him cried not to hurt him&mdash;for
      all somebody&rsquo;s orders, provost&mdash;for he was the bravest fellow of them
      all. Weel, as I went by the side of Harry, and felt him raise my hand up
      in the mist of the morning, as if he wished to wipe his eye&mdash;for he
      had not that freedom without my leave&mdash;my very heart was like to
      break for him, poor fellow. In the meanwhile, I had been trying and trying
      to make my hand as fine as a lady&rsquo;s, to see if I could slip it out of my
      iron wristband. You may think,&rsquo; he said, laying his broad bony hand on the
      table, &lsquo;I had work enough with such a shoulder-of-mutton fist; but if you
      observe, the shackle-bones are of the largest, and so they were obliged to
      keep the handcuff wide; at length I got my hand slipped out, and slipped
      in again; and poor Harry was sae deep in his ain thoughts, I could not
      make him sensible what I was doing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; said Alan Fairford, for whom the tale began to have some
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because there was an unchancy beast of a dragoon riding close beside us
      on the other side; and if I had let him into my confidence as well as
      Harry, it would not have been long before a pistol-ball slapped through my
      bonnet.&mdash;Well, I had little for it but to do the best I could for
      myself; and, by my conscience, it was time, when the gallows was staring
      me in the face. We were to halt for breakfast at Moffat. Well did I know
      the moors we were marching over, having hunted and hawked on every acre of
      ground in very different times. So I waited, you see, till I was on the
      edge of Errickstane-brae&mdash;Ye ken the place they call the Marquis&rsquo;s
      Beef-stand, because the Annandale loons used to put their stolen cattle in
      there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fairford intimated his ignorance,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ye must have seen it as ye came this way; it looks as if four hills were
      laying their heads together, to shut out daylight from the dark hollow
      space between them. A d&mdash;d deep, black, blackguard-looking abyss of a
      hole it is, and goes straight down from the roadside, as perpendicular as
      it can do, to be a heathery brae. At the bottom, there is a small bit of a
      brook, that you would think could hardly find, its way out from the hills
      that are so closely jammed round it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A bad pass, indeed,&rsquo; said Alan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may say that,&rsquo; continued the laird. &lsquo;Bad as it was, sir, it was my
      only chance; and though my very flesh creeped when I thought what a rumble
      I was going to get, yet I kept my heart up all the same. And so, just when
      we came on the edge of this Beef-stand of the Johnstones, I slipped out my
      hand from the handcuff, cried to Harry Gauntlet, &lsquo;Follow me!&rsquo;&mdash;whisked
      under the belly of the dragoon horse&mdash;flung my plaid round me with
      the speed of lightning&mdash;threw myself on my side, for there was no
      keeping my feet, and down the brae hurled I, over heather and fern, and
      blackberries, like a barrel down Chalmer&rsquo;s Close, in Auld Reekie. G&mdash;,
      sir, I never could help laughing when I think how the scoundrel redcoats
      must have been bumbazed; for the mist being, as I said, thick, they had
      little notion, I take it, that they were on the verge of such a dilemma. I
      was half way down&mdash;for rowing is faster wark than rinning&mdash;ere
      they could get at their arms; and then it was flash, flash, flash&mdash;rap,
      rap, rap&mdash;from the edge of the road; but my head was too jumbled to
      think anything either of that or the hard knocks I got among the stones. I
      kept my senses thegither, whilk has been thought wonderful by all that
      ever saw the place; and I helped myself with my hands as gallantly as I
      could, and to the bottom I came. There I lay for half a moment; but the
      thoughts of a gallows is worth all the salts and scent-bottles in the
      world for bringing a man to himself. Up I sprang, like a four-year-auld
      colt. All the hills were spinning round with me, like so many great big
      humming-tops. But there was nae time to think of that neither; more
      especially as the mist had risen a little with the firing. I could see the
      villains, like sae mony craws on the edge of the brae; and I reckon that
      they saw me; for some of the loons were beginning to crawl down the hill,
      but liker auld wives in their red cloaks, coming frae a field preaching,
      than such a souple lad as I was. Accordingly, they soon began to stop and
      load their pieces. Good-e&rsquo;en to you, gentlemen, thought I, if that is to
      be the gate of it. If you have any further word with me, you maun come as
      far as Carriefraw-gauns. And so off I set, and never buck went faster ower
      the braes than I did; and I never stopped till I had put three waters,
      reasonably deep, as the season was rainy, half a dozen mountains, and a
      few thousand acres of the worst moss and ling in Scotland, betwixt me and
      my friends the redcoats.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was that job which got you the name of Pate-in-Peril,&rsquo; said the
      provost, filling the glasses, and exclaiming with great emphasis, while
      his guest, much animated with the recollections which the exploit excited,
      looked round with an air of triumph for sympathy and applause,&mdash;&lsquo;Here
      is to your good health; and may you never put your neck in such a venture
      again.&rsquo; [The escape of a Jacobite gentleman while on the road to Carlisle
      to take his trial for his share in the affair of 1745, took place at
      Errickstane-brae, in the singular manner ascribed to the Laird of
      Summertrees in the text. The author has seen in his youth the gentleman to
      whom the adventure actually happened. The distance of time makes some
      indistinctness of recollection, but it is believed the real name was
      MacEwen or MacMillan.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Humph!&mdash;I do not know,&rsquo; answered Summertrees. &lsquo;I am not like to be
      tempted with another opportunity&mdash;[An old gentleman of the author&rsquo;s
      name was engaged in the affair of 1715, and with some difficulty was saved
      from the gallows by the intercession of the Duchess of Buccleugh and
      Monmouth. Her Grace, who maintained a good deal of authority over her
      clan, sent for the object of her intercession, and warning him of the risk
      which he had run, and the trouble she had taken on his account, wound up
      her lecture by intimating that in case of such disloyalty again, he was
      not to expect her interest in his favour. &lsquo;An it please your Grace,&rsquo; said
      the stout old Tory, &lsquo;I fear I am too old to see another opportunity.&lsquo;] Yet
      who knows?&rsquo; And then he made a deep pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May I ask what became of your friend, sir?&rsquo; said Alan Fairford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, poor Harry!&rsquo; said Summertrees. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, sir, it takes
      time to make up one&rsquo;s mind to such a venture, as my friend the provost
      calls it; and I was told by Neil Maclean,&mdash;who was next file to us,
      but had the luck to escape the gallows by some sleight-of-hand trick or
      other,&mdash;that, upon my breaking off, poor Harry stood like one
      motionless, although all our brethren in captivity made as much tumult as
      they could, to distract the attention of the soldiers. And run he did at
      last; but he did not know the ground, and either from confusion, or
      because he judged the descent altogether perpendicular, he fled up the
      hill to the left, instead of going down at once, and so was easily pursued
      and taken. If he had followed my example, he would have found enough among
      the shepherds to hide him, and feed him, as they did me, on bearmeal
      scenes and braxy mutton, till better days came round again.&rsquo; [BRAXY
      MUTTON.&mdash;The flesh of sheep that has died of disease, not by the hand
      of the butcher. In pastoral countries it is used as food with little
      scruple.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He suffered then for his share in the insurrection?&rsquo; said Alan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may swear that,&rsquo; said Summertrees. &lsquo;His blood was too red to be
      spared when that sort of paint was in request. He suffered, sir, as you
      call it&mdash;that is, he was murdered in cold blood, with many a pretty
      fellow besides. Well, we may have our day next&mdash;what is fristed is
      not forgiven&mdash;they think us all dead and buried&mdash;but&rsquo;&mdash;Here
      he filled his glass, and muttering some indistinct denunciations, drank it
      off, and assumed his usual manner, which had been a little disturbed
      towards the end of the narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What became of Mr. Redgauntlet&rsquo;s child?&rsquo; said Fairford.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISTER Redgauntlet! He was Sir Henry Redgauntlet, as his son, if the child
      now lives, will be Sir Arthur&mdash;I called him Harry from intimacy, and
      Redgauntlet, as the chief of his name&mdash;His proper style was Sir Henry
      Redgauntlet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His son, therefore, is dead?&rsquo; said Alan Fairford. &lsquo;It is a pity so brave
      a line should draw to a close.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has left a brother,&rsquo; said Summertrees, &lsquo;Edward Hugh Redgauntlet, who
      has now the representation of the family. And well it is; for though he be
      unfortunate in many respects, he will keep up the honour of the house
      better than a boy bred up amongst these bitter Whigs, the relations of his
      elder brother Sir Henry&rsquo;s lady. Then they are on no good terms with the
      Redgauntlet line&mdash;bitter Whigs they are in every sense. It was a
      runaway match betwixt Sir Henry and his lady. Poor thing, they would not
      allow her to see him when in confinement&mdash;they had even the meanness
      to leave him without pecuniary assistance; and as all his own property was
      seized upon and plundered, he would have wanted common necessaries, but
      for the attachment of a fellow who was a famous fiddler&mdash;a blind man&mdash;I
      have seen him with Sir Henry myself, both before the affair broke out and
      while it was going on. I have heard that he fiddled in the streets of
      Carlisle, and carried what money he got to his master, while he was
      confined in the castle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not believe a word of it,&rsquo; said Mrs. Crosbie, kindling with
      indignation. &lsquo;A Redgauntlet would have died twenty times before he had
      touched a fiddler&rsquo;s wages.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hout fye&mdash;hout fye&mdash;all nonsense and pride,&rsquo; said the Laird of
      Summertrees. &lsquo;Scornful dogs will eat dirty puddings, cousin Crosbie&mdash;ye
      little ken what some of your friends were obliged to do yon time for a
      sowp of brose, or a bit of bannock. G&mdash;d, I carried a cutler&rsquo;s wheel
      for several weeks, partly for need, and partly for disguise&mdash;there I
      went bizz&mdash;bizz&mdash;whizz&mdash;zizz, at every auld wife&rsquo;s door;
      and if ever you want your shears sharpened, Mrs. Crosbie, I am the lad to
      do it for you, if my wheel was but in order.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You, must ask my leave first,&rsquo; said the provost; &lsquo;for I have been told
      you had some queer fashions of taking a kiss instead of a penny, if you
      liked your customer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, come, provost,&rsquo; said the lady; rising, &lsquo;if the maut gets abune the
      meal with you, it is time for me to take myself away&mdash;And you will
      come to my room, gentlemen, when you want a cup of tea.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan Fairford was not sorry for the lady&rsquo;s departure. She seemed too much
      alive to the honour of the house of Redgauntlet, though only a fourth
      cousin, not to be alarmed by the inquiries which he proposed to make after
      the whereabout of its present head. Strange confused suspicions arose in
      his mind, from his imperfect recollection of the tale of Wandering Willie,
      and the idea forced itself upon him that his friend Darsie Latimer might
      be the son of the unfortunate Sir Henry. But before indulging in such
      speculations, the point was to discover what had actually become of him.
      If he were in the hands of his uncle, might there not exist some rivalry
      in fortune, or rank, which might induce so stern a man as Redgauntlet to
      use unfair measures towards a youth whom he would find himself unable to
      mould to his purpose? He considered these points in silence, during
      several revolutions of the glasses as they wheeled in galaxy round the
      bowl, waiting until the provost, agreeably to his own proposal, should
      mention the subject, for which he had expressly introduced him to Mr.
      Maxwell of Summertrees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently the provost had forgot his promise, or at least was in no great
      haste to fulfil it. He debated with great earnestness upon the Stamp Act,
      which was then impending over the American colonies, and upon other
      political subjects of the day, but said not a word of Redgauntlet. Alan
      soon saw that the investigation he meditated must advance, if at all, on
      his own special motion, and determined to proceed accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Acting upon this resolution, he took the first opportunity afforded by a
      pause in the discussion of colonial politics, to say, &lsquo;I must remind you,
      Provost Crosbie, of your kind promise to procure some intelligence upon
      the subject I am so anxious about.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gadso!&rsquo; said the provost, after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, &lsquo;it is very true.&mdash;Mr.
      Maxwell, we wish to consult you on a piece of important business. You must
      know indeed I think you must have heard, that the fishermen at Brokenburn,
      and higher up the Solway, have made a raid upon Quaker Geddes&rsquo;s
      stake-nets, and levelled all with the sands.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In troth I heard it, provost, and I was glad to hear the scoundrels had
      so much pluck left as to right themselves against a fashion which would
      make the upper heritors a sort of clocking-hens, to hatch the fish that
      folk below them were to catch and eat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir,&rsquo; said Alan, &lsquo;that is not the present point. But a young friend
      of mine was with Mr. Geddes at the time this violent procedure took place,
      and he has not since been heard of. Now, our friend, the provost, thinks
      that you may be able to advise&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he was interrupted by the provost and Summertrees speaking out both
      at once, the first endeavouring to disclaim all interest in the question,
      and the last to evade giving an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Me think!&rsquo; said the provost; &lsquo;I never thought twice about it, Mr.
      Fairford; it was neither fish, nor flesh, nor salt herring of mine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I &ldquo;able to advise&rdquo;!&rsquo; said Mr. Maxwell of Summertrees; &lsquo;what the devil
      can I advise you to do, excepting to send the bellman through the town to
      cry your lost sheep, as they do spaniel dogs or stray ponies?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With your pardon,&rsquo; said Alan, calmly, but resolutely, &lsquo;I must ask a more
      serious answer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, Mr. Advocate,&rsquo; answered Summertrees, &lsquo;I thought it was your business
      to give advice to the lieges, and not to take it from poor stupid country
      gentlemen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If not exactly advice, it is sometimes our duty to ask questions, Mr.
      Maxwell.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, sir, when you have your bag-wig and your gown on, we must allow you
      the usual privilege of both gown and petticoat, to ask what questions you
      please. But when you are out of your canonicals, the case is altered. How
      come you, sir, to suppose that I have any business with this riotous
      proceeding, or should know more than you do what happened there? the
      question proceeds on an uncivil supposition.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will explain,&rsquo; said Alan, determined to give Mr. Maxwell no opportunity
      of breaking off the conversation. &lsquo;You are an intimate of Mr. Redgauntlet&mdash;he
      is accused of having been engaged in this affray, and of having placed
      under forcible restraint the person of my friend, Darsie Latimer, a young
      man of property and consequence, whose fate I am here for the express
      purpose of investigating. This is the plain state of the case; and all
      parties concerned,&mdash;your friend, in particular,&mdash;will have
      reason to be thankful for the temperate manner in which it is my purpose
      to conduct the matter, if I am treated with proportionate frankness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have misunderstood me,&rsquo; said Maxwell, with a tone changed to more
      composure; &lsquo;I told you I was the friend of the late Sir Henry Redgauntlet,
      who was executed, in 1745, at Hairibie, near Carlisle, but I know no one
      who at present bears the name of Redgauntlet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know Mr. Herries of Birrenswork,&rsquo; said Alan, smiling, &lsquo;to whom the
      name of Redgauntlet belongs?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maxwell darted a keen reproachful look towards the provost, but instantly
      smoothed his brow, and changed his tone to that of confidence and candour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must not be angry, Mr. Fairford, that the poor persecuted nonjurors
      are a little upon the QUI VIVE when such clever young men as you are
      making inquiries after us. I myself now, though I am quite out of the
      scrape, and may cock my hat at the Cross as I best like, sunshine or
      moonshine, have been yet so much accustomed to walk with the lap of my
      cloak cast over my face, that, faith, if a redcoat walk suddenly up to me,
      I wish for my wheel and whetstone again for a moment. Now Redgauntlet,
      poor fellow, is far worse off&mdash;he is, you may have heard, still under
      the lash of the law,&mdash;the mark of the beast is still on his forehead,
      poor gentleman,&mdash;and that makes us cautious&mdash;very cautious,
      which I am sure there is no occasion to be towards you, as no one of your
      appearance and manners would wish to trepan a gentleman under misfortune.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On the contrary, sir,&rsquo; said Fairford, &lsquo;I wish to afford Mr. Redgauntlet&rsquo;s
      friends an opportunity to get him out of the scrape, by procuring the
      instant liberation of my friend Darsie Latimer. I will engage that if he
      has sustained no greater bodily harm than a short confinement, the matter
      may be passed over quietly, without inquiry; but to attain this end, so
      desirable for the man who has committed a great and recent infraction of
      the laws, which he had before grievously offended, very speedy reparation
      of the wrong must be rendered.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maxwell seemed lost in reflection, and exchanged a glance or two, not of
      the most comfortable or congratulatory kind, with his host the provost.
      Fairford rose and walked about the room, to allow them an opportunity of
      conversing together; for he was in hopes that the impression he had
      visibly made upon Summertrees was likely to ripen into something
      favourable to his purpose. They took the opportunity, and engaged in
      whispers to each other, eagerly and reproachfully on the part of the
      laird, while the provost answered in an embarrassed and apologetical tone.
      Some broken words of the conversation reached Fairford, whose presence
      they seemed to forget, as he stood at the bottom of the room, apparently
      intent upon examining the figures upon a fine Indian screen, a present to
      the provost from his brother, captain of a vessel in the Company&rsquo;s
      service. What he overheard made it evident that his errand, and the
      obstinacy with which he pursued it, occasioned altercation between the
      whisperers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maxwell at length let out the words, &lsquo;A good fright; and so send him home
      with his tail scalded, like a dog that has come a-privateering on strange
      premises.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The provost&rsquo;s negative was strongly interposed&mdash;&lsquo;Not to be thought
      of&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;making bad worse&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;my situation&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;my utility&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;you
      cannot conceive how obstinate&mdash;just like his father&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      They then whispered more closely, and at length the provost raised his
      drooping crest, and spoke in a cheerful tone. &lsquo;Come, sit down to your
      glass, Mr. Fairford; we have laid our heads thegither, and you shall see
      it will not be our fault if you are not quite pleased, and Mr. Darsie
      Latimer let loose to take his fiddle under his neck again. But Summertrees
      thinks it will require you to put yourself into some bodily risk, which
      maybe you may not be so keen of.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gentlemen,&rsquo; said Fairford, &lsquo;I will not certainly shun any risk by which
      my object may be accomplished; but I bind it on your consciences&mdash;on
      yours, Mr. Maxwell, as a man of honour and a gentleman; and on yours,
      provost, as a magistrate and a loyal subject, that you do not mislead me
      in this matter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, as for me,&rsquo; said Summertrees, &lsquo;I will tell you the truth at once,
      and fairly own that I can certainly find you the means of seeing
      Redgauntlet, poor man; and that I will do, if you require it, and conjure
      him also to treat you as your errand requires; but poor Redgauntlet is
      much changed&mdash;indeed, to say truth, his temper never was the best in
      the world; however, I will warrant you from any very great danger.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will warrant myself from such,&rsquo; said Fairford, &lsquo;by carrying a proper
      force with me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed,&rsquo; said Summertrees, &lsquo;you will, do no such thing; for, in the first
      place, do you think that we will deliver up the poor fellow into the hands
      of the Philistines, when, on the contrary, my only reason for furnishing
      you with the clue I am to put into your hands, is to settle the matter
      amicably on all sides? And secondly, his intelligence is so good, that
      were you coming near him with soldiers, or constables, or the like, I
      shall answer for it, you will never lay salt on his tail.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fairford mused for a moment. He considered that to gain sight of this man,
      and knowledge of his friend&rsquo;s condition, were advantages to be purchased
      at every personal risk; and he saw plainly, that were he to take the
      course most safe for himself, and call in the assistance of the law, it
      was clear he would either be deprived of the intelligence necessary to
      guide him, or that Redgauntlet would be apprised of his danger, and might
      probably leave the country, carrying his captive along with him. He
      therefore repeated, &lsquo;I put myself on your honour, Mr. Maxwell; and I will
      go alone to visit your friend. I have little; doubt I shall find him
      amenable to reason; and that I shall receive from him a satisfactory
      account of Mr. Latimer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have little doubt that you will,&rsquo; said Mr. Maxwell of Summertrees; &lsquo;but
      still I think it will be only in the long run, and after having sustained
      some delay and inconvenience. My warrandice goes no further.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will take it as it is given,&rsquo; said Alan Fairford. &lsquo;But let me ask,
      would it not be better, since you value your friend&rsquo;s safety so highly and
      surely would not willingly compromise mine, that the provost or you should
      go with me to this man, if he is within any reasonable distance, and try
      to make him hear reason?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Me!&mdash;I will not go my foot&rsquo;s length,&rsquo; said the provost; and that,
      Mr. Alan, you may be well assured of. Mr. Redgauntlet is my wife&rsquo;s fourth
      cousin, that is undeniable; but were he the last of her kin and mine both,
      it would ill befit my office to be communing with rebels.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, or drinking with nonjurors,&rsquo; said Maxwell, filling his glass. &lsquo;I
      would as soon expect; to have met Claverhouse at a field-preaching. And as
      for myself, Mr. Fairford, I cannot go, for just the opposite reason. It
      would be INFRA DIG. in the provost of this most flourishing and loyal town
      to associate with Redgauntlet; and for me it would be NOSCITUR A SOCIO.
      There would be post to London, with the tidings that two such Jacobites as
      Redgauntlet and I had met on a braeside&mdash;the Habeas Corpus would be
      suspended&mdash;Fame would sound a charge from Carlisle to the Land&rsquo;s End&mdash;and
      who knows but the very wind of the rumour might blow my estate from
      between my fingers, and my body over Errickstane-brae again? No, no; bide
      a gliff&mdash;I will go into the provost&rsquo;s closet, and write a letter to
      Redgauntlet, and direct you how to deliver it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is pen and ink in the office,&rsquo; said the provost, pointing to the
      door of an inner apartment, in which he had his walnut-tree desk and
      east-country cabinet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A pen that can write, I hope?&rsquo; said the old laird.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It can write and spell baith in right hands,&rsquo; answered the provost, as
      the laird retired and shut the door behind him.

      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      NARRATIVE OF ALAN FAIRFORD, CONTINUED
    </h3>
    <p>
      The room was no sooner deprived of Mr. Maxwell of Summertrees&rsquo;s presence,
      than the provost looked very warily above, beneath, and around the
      apartment, hitched his chair towards that of his remaining guest, and
      began to speak In a whisper which could not have startled &lsquo;the smallest
      mouse that creeps on floor.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Fairford,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you are a good lad; and, what is more, you are
      my auld friend your father&rsquo;s son. Your father has been agent for this
      burgh for years, and has a good deal to say with the council; so there
      have been a sort of obligations between him and me; it may have been now
      on this side and now on that; but obligations there have been. I am but a
      plain man, Mr. Fairford; but I hope you understand me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe you mean me well, provost; and I am sure,&rsquo; replied Fairford,
      &lsquo;you can never better show your kindness than on this occasion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s it&mdash;that&rsquo;s the very point I would be at, Mr. Alan,&rsquo; replied
      the provost; &lsquo;besides, I am, as becomes well my situation, a stanch friend
      to kirk and king, meaning this present establishment in church and state;
      and so, as I was saying, you may command my best&mdash;advice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope for your assistance and co-operation also,&rsquo; said the youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, certainly,&rsquo; said the wary magistrate. &lsquo;Well, now, you see one
      may love the kirk, and yet not ride on the rigging of it; and one may love
      the king, and yet not be cramming him eternally down the throat of the
      unhappy folk that may chance to like another king better. I have friends
      and connexions among them, Mr. Fairford, as your father may have clients&mdash;they
      are flesh and blood like ourselves, these poor Jacobite bodies&mdash;sons
      of Adam and Eve, after all; and therefore&mdash;I hope you understand me?&mdash;I
      am a plain-spoken man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid I do not quite understand you,&rsquo; said Fairford; &lsquo;and if you
      have anything to say to me in private, my dear provost, you had better
      come quickly out with it, for the Laird of Summertrees must finish his
      letter in a minute or two.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a bit, man&mdash;Pate is a lang-headed fellow, but his pen does not
      clear the paper as his greyhound does the Tinwald-furs. I gave him a wipe
      about that, if you noticed; I can say anything to Pate-in-Peril&mdash;Indeed,
      he is my wife&rsquo;s near kinsman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But your advice, provost,&rsquo; said Alan, who perceived that, like a shy
      horse, the worthy magistrate always started off from his own purpose just
      when he seemed approaching to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Weel, you shall have it in plain terms, for I am a plain man. Ye see, we
      will suppose that any friend like yourself were in the deepest hole of the
      Nith, sand making a sprattle for your life. Now, you see, such being the
      case, I have little chance of helping you, being a fat, short-armed man,
      and no swimmer, and what would be the use of my jumping in after you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I understand you, I think,&rsquo; said Alan Fairford. &lsquo;You think that Darsie
      Latimer is in danger of his life?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Me!&mdash;I think nothing about it, Mr. Alan; but if he were, as I trust
      he is not, he is nae drap&rsquo;s blood akin to you, Mr. Alan.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But here your friend, Summertrees,&rsquo; said the young lawyer, &lsquo;offers me a
      letter to this Redgauntlet of yours&mdash;What say you to that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Me!&rsquo; ejaculated the provost, &lsquo;me, Mr. Alan? I say neither buff nor stye
      to it&mdash;But ye dinna ken what it is to look a Redgauntlet in the face;&mdash;better
      try my wife, who is but a fourth cousin, before ye venture on the laird
      himself&mdash;just say something about the Revolution, and see what a look
      she can gie you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall leave you to stand all the shots from that battery, provost.&rsquo; 
      replied Fairford. &lsquo;But speak out like a man&mdash;Do you think Summertrees
      means fairly by me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fairly&mdash;he is just coming&mdash;fairly? I am a plain man, Mr.
      Fairford&mdash;but ye said FAIRLY?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do so,&rsquo; replied Alan, &lsquo;and it is of importance to me to know, and to
      you to tell me if such is the case; for if you do not, you may be an
      accomplice to murder before the fact, and that under circumstances which
      may bring it near to murder under trust.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Murder!&mdash;who spoke of murder?&rsquo; said the provost; no danger of that,
      Mr. Alan&mdash;only, if I were you&mdash;to speak my plain mind&rsquo;&mdash;Here
      he approached his mouth to the ear of the young lawyer, and, after another
      acute pang of travail, was safely delivered of his advice in the following
      abrupt words:&mdash;&lsquo;Take a keek into Pate&rsquo;s letter before ye deliver it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fairford started, looked the provost hard in the face, and was silent;
      while Mr. Crosbie, with the self-approbation of one who has at length
      brought himself to the discharge of a great duty, at the expense of a
      considerable sacrifice, nodded and winked to Alan, as if enforcing his
      advice; and then swallowing a large glass of punch, concluded, with the
      sigh of a man released from a heavy burden, &lsquo;I am a plain man, Mr.
      Fairford.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A plain man?&rsquo; said Maxwell, who entered the room at that moment, with the
      letter in his hand,&mdash;&lsquo;Provost, I never heard you make use of the word
      but when you had some sly turn of your own to work out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The provost looked silly enough, and the Laird of Summertrees directed a
      keen and suspicious glance upon Alan Fairford, who sustained it with
      professional intrepidity.&mdash;There was a moment&rsquo;s pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was trying,&rsquo; said the provost, &lsquo;to dissuade our young friend from his
      wildgoose expedition.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I,&rsquo; said Fairford, &lsquo;am determined to go through with it. Trusting
      myself to you, Mr. Maxwell, I conceive that I rely, as I before said, on
      the word of a gentleman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will warrant you,&rsquo; said Maxwell, &lsquo;from all serious consequences&mdash;some
      inconveniences you must look to suffer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To these I shall be resigned,&rsquo; said Fairford, &lsquo;and stand prepared to run
      my risk.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well then,&rsquo; said Summertrees, &lsquo;you must go&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will leave you to yourselves, gentlemen,&rsquo; said the provost, rising;
      &lsquo;when you have done with your crack, you will find me at my wife&rsquo;s
      tea-table.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And a more accomplished old woman never drank catlap,&rsquo; said Maxwell, as
      he shut the door; &lsquo;the last word has him, speak it who will&mdash;and yet
      because he is a whillywhaw body, and has a plausible tongue of his own,
      and is well enough connected, and especially because nobody could ever
      find out whether he is Whig or Tory, this is the third time they have made
      him provost!&mdash;But to the matter in hand. This letter, Mr. Fairford,&rsquo; 
      putting a sealed one into his hand, &lsquo;is addressed, you observe, to Mr. H&mdash;of
      B&mdash;, and contains your credentials for that gentlemen, who is also
      known by his family name of Redgauntlet, but less frequently addressed by
      it, because it is mentioned something invidiously in a certain Act of
      Parliament. I have little doubt he will assure you of your friend&rsquo;s
      safety, and in a short time place him at freedom&mdash;that is, supposing
      him under present restraint. But the point is, to discover where he is&mdash;and,
      before you are made acquainted with this necessary part of the business,
      you must give me your assurance of honour that you will acquaint no one,
      either by word or letter, with the expedition which you now propose to
      yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How, sir?&rsquo; answered Alan; &lsquo;can you expect that I will not take the
      precaution of informing some person of the route I am about to take, that
      in case of accident it may be known where I am, and with what purpose I
      have gone thither?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And can you expect,&rsquo; answered Maxwell, in the same tone, &lsquo;that I am to
      place my friend&rsquo;s safety, not merely in your hands, but in those of any
      person you may choose to confide in, and who may use the knowledge to his
      destruction? Na&mdash;na&mdash;I have pledged my word for your safety, and
      you must give me yours to be private in the matter&mdash;giff-gaff, you
      know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan Fairford could not help thinking that this obligation to secrecy gave
      a new and suspicious colouring to the whole transaction; but, considering
      that his friend&rsquo;s release might depend upon his accepting the condition,
      he gave it in the terms proposed, and with the purpose of abiding by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now, sir,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;whither am I to proceed with this letter? Is Mr.
      Herries at Brokenburn?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is not; I do not think he will come thither again until the business
      of the stake-nets be hushed up, nor would I advise him to do so&mdash;the
      Quakers, with all their demureness, can bear malice as long as other folk;
      and though I have not the prudence of Mr. Provost, who refuses to ken
      where his friends are concealed during adversity, lest, perchance, he
      should be asked to contribute to their relief, yet I do not think it
      necessary or prudent to inquire into Redgauntlet&rsquo;s wanderings, poor man,
      but wish to remain at perfect freedom to answer, if asked at, that I ken
      nothing of the matter. You must, then, go to old Tom Trumbull&rsquo;s at Annan,&mdash;Tam
      Turnpenny, as they call him,&mdash;and he is sure either to know where
      Redgauntlet is himself, or to find some one who can give a shrewd guess.
      But you must attend that old Turnpenny will answer no question on such a
      subject without you give him the passport, which at present you must do,
      by asking him the age of the moon; if he answers, &ldquo;Not light enough to
      land a cargo,&rdquo; you are to answer, &ldquo;Then plague on Aberdeen Almanacks,&rdquo; and
      upon that he will hold free intercourse with you. And now, I would advise
      you to lose no time, for the parole is often changed&mdash;and take care
      of yourself among these moonlight lads, for laws and lawyers do not stand
      very high in their favour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will set out this instant,&rsquo; said the young barrister; &lsquo;I will but bid
      the provost and Mrs. Crosbie farewell, and then get on horseback so soon
      as the ostler of the George Inn can saddle him;&mdash;as for the
      smugglers, I am neither gauger nor supervisor, and, like the man who met
      the devil, if they have nothing to say to me, I have nothing to say to
      them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are a mettled young man,&rsquo; said Summertrees, evidently with increasing
      goodwill, on observing an alertness and contempt of danger, which perhaps
      he did not expect from Alan&rsquo;s appearance and profession,&mdash;&lsquo;a very
      mettled young fellow indeed! and it is almost a pity&rsquo;&mdash;Here he
      stopped abort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is a pity?&rsquo; said Fairford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is almost a pity that I cannot go with you myself, or at least send a
      trusty guide.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked together to the bedchamber of Mrs. Crosbie, for it was in that
      asylum that the ladies of the period dispensed their tea, when the parlour
      was occupied by the punch-bowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have been good bairns to-night, gentlemen,&rsquo; said Mrs. Crosbie; &lsquo;I am
      afraid, Summertrees, that the provost has given you a bad browst; you are
      not used to quit the lee-side of the punch-bowl in such a hurry. I say
      nothing to you, Mr. Fairford, for you are too young a man yet for stoup
      and bicker; but I hope you will not tell the Edinburgh fine folk that the
      provost has scrimped you of your cogie, as the sang says?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am much obliged for the provost&rsquo;s kindness, and yours, madam,&rsquo; replied
      Alan; &lsquo;but the truth is, I have still a long ride before me this evening
      and the sooner I am on horse-back the better.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This evening?&rsquo; said the provost, anxiously; &lsquo;had you not better take
      daylight with you to-morrow morning?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Fairford will ride as well in the cool of the evening,&rsquo; said
      Summertrees, taking the word out of Alan&rsquo;s mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The provost said no more, nor did his wife ask any questions, nor testify
      any surprise at the suddenness of their guest&rsquo;s departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having drunk tea, Alan Fairford took leave with the usual ceremony. The
      Laird of Summertrees seemed studious to prevent any further communication
      between him and the provost, and remained lounging on the landing-place of
      the stair while they made their adieus&mdash;heard the provost ask if Alan
      proposed a speedy return, and the latter reply that his stay was
      uncertain, and witnessed the parting shake of the hand, which, with a
      pressure more warm than usual, and a tremulous, &lsquo;God bless and prosper
      you!&rsquo; Mr. Crosbie bestowed on his young friend. Maxwell even strolled with
      Fairford as far as the George, although resisting all his attempts at
      further inquiry into the affairs of Redgauntlet, and referring him to Tom
      Trumbull, alias Turnpenny, for the particulars which he might find it
      necessary to inquire into.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length Alan&rsquo;s hack was produced&mdash;an animal long in neck, and high
      in bone, accoutred with a pair of saddle-bags containing the rider&rsquo;s
      travelling wardrobe. Proudly surmounting his small stock of necessaries,
      and no way ashamed of a mode of travelling which a modern Mr. Silvertongue
      would consider as the last of degradations, Alan Fairford took leave of
      the old Jacobite, Pate-in-Peril, and set forward on the road to the loyal
      burgh of Annan. His reflections during his ride were none of the most
      pleasant. He could not disguise from himself that he was venturing rather
      too rashly into the power of outlawed and desperate persons; for with such
      only, a man in the situation of Redgauntlet could be supposed to
      associate. There were other grounds for apprehension, Several marks of
      intelligence betwixt Mrs. Crosbie and the Laird of Summertrees had not
      escaped Alan&rsquo;s acute observation; and it was plain that the provost&rsquo;s
      inclinations towards him, which he believed to be sincere and good, were
      not firm enough to withstand the influence of this league between his wife
      and friend. The provost&rsquo;s adieus, like Macbeth&rsquo;s amen, had stuck in his
      throat, and seemed to intimate that he apprehended more than he dared give
      utterance to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laying all these matters together, Alan thought, with no little anxiety on
      the celebrated lines of Shakespeare,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                  &mdash; A drop,
  That in the ocean seeks another drop, &amp;c.
</pre>
    <p>
      But pertinacity was a strong feature in the young lawyer&rsquo;s character. He
      was, and always had been, totally unlike the &lsquo;horse hot at hand,&rsquo; who
      tires before noon through his own over eager exertions in the beginning of
      the day. On the contrary, his first efforts seemed frequently inadequate
      to accomplishing his purpose, whatever that for the time might be; and it
      was only as the difficulties of the task increased, that his mind seemed
      to acquire the energy necessary to combat and subdue them. If, therefore,
      he went anxiously forward upon his uncertain and perilous expedition, the
      reader must acquit him of all idea, even in a passing thought, of the
      possibility of abandoning his search, and resigning Darsie Latimer to his
      destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      A couple of hours&rsquo; riding brought him to the little town of Annan,
      situated on the shores of the Solway, between eight and nine o&rsquo;clock. The
      sun had set, but the day was not yet ended; and when he had alighted and
      seen his horse properly cared for at the principal inn of the place, he
      was readily directed to Mr. Maxwell&rsquo;s friend, old Tom Trumbull, with whom
      everybody seemed well acquainted. He endeavoured to fish out from the lad
      that acted as a guide, something of this man&rsquo;s situation and profession;
      but the general expressions of &lsquo;a very decent man&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;a very honest
      body&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;weel to pass in the world,&rsquo; and such like, were all that
      could be extracted from him; and while Fairford was following up the
      investigation with closer interrogatories, the lad put an end to them by
      knocking at the door of Mr. Trumbull, whose decent dwelling was a little
      distance from the town, and considerably nearer to the sea. It was one of
      a little row of houses running down to the waterside, and having gardens
      and other accommodations behind. There was heard within the uplifting of a
      Scottish psalm; and the boy saying, &lsquo;They are at exercise, sir,&rsquo; gave
      intimation they might not be admitted till prayers were over.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, however, Fairford repeated the summons with the end of his whip, the
      singing ceased, and Mr. Trumbull himself, with his psalm-book in his hand,
      kept open by the insertion of his forefinger between the leaves, came to
      demand the meaning of this unseasonable interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could be more different than his whole appearance seemed to be
      from the confidant of a desperate man, and the associate of outlaws in
      their unlawful enterprises. He was a tall, thin, bony figure, with white
      hair combed straight down on each side of his face, and an iron-grey hue
      of complexion; where the lines, or rather, as Quin said of Macklin, the
      cordage, of his countenance were so sternly adapted to a devotional and
      even ascetic expression, that they left no room for any indication of
      reckless daring or sly dissimulation. In short, Trumbull appeared a
      perfect specimen of the rigid old Covenanter, who said only what he
      thought right, acted on no other principle but that of duty, and, if he
      committed errors, did so under the full impression that he was serving God
      rather than man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you want me, sir?&rsquo; he said to Fairford, whose guide had slunk to the
      rear, as if to escape the rebuke of the severe old man,&mdash;&lsquo;We were
      engaged, and it is the Saturday night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan Fairford&rsquo;s preconceptions were so much deranged by this man&rsquo;s
      appearance and manner, that he stood for a moment bewildered, and would as
      soon have thought of giving a cant password to a clergyman descending from
      the pulpit, as to the respectable father of a family just interrupted in
      his prayers for and with the objects of his care. Hastily concluding Mr.
      Maxwell had passed some idle jest on him, or rather that he had mistaken
      the person to whom he was directed, he asked if he spoke to Mr. Trumbull.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To Thomas Trumbull,&rsquo; answered the old man&mdash;&lsquo;What may be your
      business, sir?&rsquo; And he glanced his eye to the book he held in his hand,
      with a sigh like that of a saint desirous of dissolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know Mr. Maxwell of Summertrees?&rsquo; said Fairford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have heard of such a gentleman in the country-side, but have no
      acquaintance with him,&rsquo; answered Mr. Trumbull; &lsquo;he is, as I have heard, a
      Papist; for the whore that sitteth on the seven hills ceaseth not yet to
      pour forth the cup of her abomination on these parts.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yet he directed me hither, my good friend,&rsquo; said Alan. &lsquo;Is there another
      of your name in this town of Annan?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None,&rsquo; replied Mr. Trumbull, &lsquo;since my worthy father was removed; he was
      indeed a shining light.&mdash;I wish you good even, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay one single instant,&rsquo; said Fairford; &lsquo;this is a matter of life and
      death.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not more than the casting the burden of our sins where they should be
      laid,&rsquo; said Thomas Trumbull, about to shut the door in the inquirer&rsquo;s
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know,&rsquo; said Alan Fairford, &lsquo;the Laird of Redgauntlet?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now Heaven defend me from treason and rebellion!&rsquo; exclaimed Trumbull.
      &lsquo;Young gentleman, you are importunate. I live here among my own people,
      and do not consort with Jacobites and mass-mongers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed about to shut the door, but did NOT shut it, a circumstance
      which did not escape Alan&rsquo;s notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Redgauntlet is sometimes,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;called Herries of Birrenswork;
      perhaps you may know him under that name.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Friend, you are uncivil,&rsquo; answered Mr. Trumbull; &lsquo;honest men have enough
      to do to keep one name undefiled. I ken nothing about those who have two.
      Good even to you, friend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was now about to slam the door in his visitor&rsquo;s face without further
      ceremony, when Alan, who had observed symptoms that the name of
      Redgauntlet did not seem altogether so indifferent to him as he pretended,
      arrested his purpose by saying, in a low voice, &lsquo;At least you can tell me
      what age the moon is?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man started, as if from a trance, and before answering, surveyed
      the querist with a keen penetrating glance, which seemed to say, &lsquo;Are you
      really in possession of this key to my confidence, or do you speak from
      mere accident?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To this keen look of scrutiny, Fairford replied by a smile of
      intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The iron muscles of the old man&rsquo;s face did not, however, relax, as he
      dropped, in a careless manner, the countersign, &lsquo;Not light enough to land
      a cargo.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then plague of all Aberdeen Almanacks!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And plague of all fools that waste time,&rsquo; said Thomas Trumbull, &lsquo;Could
      you not have said as much at first? And standing wasting time, and
      encouraging; lookers-on, in the open street too? Come in by&mdash;in by.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew his visitor into the dark entrance of the house, and shut the door
      carefully; then putting his head into an apartment which the murmurs
      within announced to be filled with the family, he said aloud, &lsquo;A work of
      necessity and mercy&mdash;Malachi, take the book&mdash;You will sing six
      double verses of the hundred and nineteen-and you may lecture out of the
      Lamentations. And, Malachi,&rsquo;&mdash;this he said in an undertone,&mdash;&lsquo;see
      you give them a a creed of doctrine that will last them till I come back;
      or else these inconsiderate lads will be out of the house, and away to the
      publics, wasting their precious time, and, it may be, putting themselves
      in the way of missing the morning tide.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      An inarticulate answer from within intimated Malachi&rsquo;s acquiescence in the
      commands imposed; and, Mr. Trumbull, shutting the door, muttered something
      about fast bind, fast find, turned the key, and put it into his pocket;
      and then bidding his visitor have a care of his steps, and make no noise,
      he led him through the house, and out at a back-door, into a little
      garden. Here a plaited alley conducted them, without the possibility of
      their being seen by any neighbour, to a door in the garden-wall, which
      being opened, proved to be a private entrance into a three-stalled stable;
      in one of which was a horse, that whinnied on their entrance. &lsquo;Hush,
      hush!&rsquo; cried the old man, and presently seconded his exhortations to
      silence by throwing a handful of corn into the manger, and the horse soon
      converted his acknowledgement of their presence into the usual sound of
      munching and grinding his provender.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the light was now failing fast, the old man, with much more alertness
      than might have been expected from the rigidity of his figure, closed the
      window-shutters in an instant, produced phosphorus and matches, and
      lighted a stable-lantern, which he placed on the corn-bin, and then
      addressed Fairford. &lsquo;We are private here, young man; and as some time has
      been wasted already, you will be so kind as to tell me what is your
      errand. Is it about the way of business, or the other job?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My business with you, Mr. Trumbull, is to request you will find me the
      means of delivering this letter, from Mr. Maxwell of Summertrees to the
      Laird of Redgauntlet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Humph&mdash;fashious job! Pate Maxwell will still be the auld man&mdash;always
      Pate-in-Peril&mdash;Craig-in-Peril, for what I know. Let me see the letter
      from him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He examined it with much care, turning it up and down, and looking at the
      seal very attentively. &lsquo;All&rsquo;s right, I see; it has the private mark for
      haste and speed. I bless my Maker that I am no great man, or great man&rsquo;s
      fellow; and so I think no more of these passages than just to help them
      forward in the way of business. You are an utter stranger in these parts,
      I warrant?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fairford answered in the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye&mdash;I never saw them make a wiser choice&mdash;I must call some one
      to direct you what to do&mdash;Stay, we must go to him, I believe. You are
      well recommended to me, friend, and doubtless trusty; otherwise you may
      see more than I would like to show, or am in the use of showing in the
      common line of business.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Saying this, he placed his lantern on the ground, beside the post of one
      of the empty stalls, drew up a small spring bolt which secured it to the
      floor, and then forcing the post to one side, discovered a small
      trap-door. &lsquo;Follow me,&rsquo; he said, and dived into the subterranean descent
      to which this secret aperture gave access.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fairford plunged after him, not without apprehensions of more kinds than
      one, but still resolved to prosecute the adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The descent, which was not above six feet, led to a very narrow passage,
      which seemed to have been constructed for the precise purpose of excluding
      every one who chanced to be an inch more in girth than was his conductor.
      A small vaulted room, of about eight feet square, received them at the end
      of this lane. Here Mr. Trumbull left Fairford alone, and returned for an
      instant, as he said, to shut his concealed trap-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fairford liked not his departure, as it left him in utter darkness;
      besides that his breathing was much affected by a strong and stifling
      smell of spirits, and other articles of a savour more powerful than
      agreeable to the lungs. He was very glad, therefore, when he heard the
      returning steps of Mr. Trumbull, who, when once more by his side, opened a
      strong though narrow door in the wall, and conveyed Fairford into an
      immense magazine of spirit-casks, and other articles of contraband trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a small, light at the end of this range of well-stocked
      subterranean vaults, which, upon a low whistle, began to flicker and move
      towards them. An undefined figure, holding a dark lantern, with the light
      averted, approached them, whom Mr. Trumbull thus addressed:&mdash;&lsquo;Why
      were you not at worship, Job; and this Saturday at e&rsquo;en?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Swanston was loading the JENNY, sir; and I stayed to serve out the
      article.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;True&mdash;a work of necessity, and in the way of business. Does the
      JUMPING JENNY sail this tide?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, aye, sir; she sails for&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did not ask you WHERE she sailed for, Job,&rsquo; said the old gentleman,
      interrupting him. &lsquo;I thank my Maker, I know nothing of their incomings or
      outgoings. I sell my article fairly and in the ordinary way of business;
      and I wash my hands of everything else. But what I wished to know is,
      whether the gentleman called the Laird of the Solway Lakes is on the other
      side of the Border even now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, aye,&rsquo; said Job, &lsquo;the laird is something in my own line, you know&mdash;a
      little contraband or so, There is a statute for him&mdash;But no matter;
      he took the sands after the splore at the Quaker&rsquo;s fish-traps yonder; for
      he has a leal heart, the laird, and is always true to the country-side.
      But avast&mdash;is all snug here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he suddenly turned on Alan Fairford the light side of the
      lantern he carried, who, by the transient gleam which it threw in passing
      on the man who bore it, saw a huge figure, upwards of six feet high, with
      a rough hairy cap on his head, and a set of features corresponding to his
      bulky frame. He thought also he observed pistols at his belt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will answer for this gentleman,&rsquo; said Mr. Trumbull; &lsquo;he must be brought
      to speech of the laird.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That will be kittle steering,&rsquo; said the subordinate personage; &lsquo;for I
      understood that the laird and his folk were no sooner on the other side
      than the land-sharks were on them, and some mounted lobsters from
      Carlisle; and so they were obliged to split and squander. There are new
      brooms out to sweep the country of them, they say; for the brush was a
      hard one; and they say there was a lad drowned;&mdash;he was not one of
      the laird&rsquo;s gang, so there was the less matter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Peace! prithee, peace, Job Rutledge,&rsquo; said honest, pacific Mr. Trumbull.
      &lsquo;I wish thou couldst remember, man, that I desire to know nothing of your
      roars and splores, your brooms and brushes. I dwell here among my own
      people; and I sell my commodity to him who comes in the way of business;
      and so wash my hands of all consequences, as becomes a quiet subject and
      an honest man. I never take payment, save in ready money.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, aye,&rsquo; muttered he with the lantern, &lsquo;your worship, Mr. Trumbull,
      understands that in the way of business.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I hope you will one day know, Job,&rsquo; answered Mr. Trumbull,&mdash;&lsquo;the
      comfort of a conscience void of offence, and that fears neither gauger nor
      collector, neither excise nor customs. The business is to pass this
      gentleman to Cumberland upon earnest business, and to procure him speech
      with the Laird of the Solway Lakes&mdash;I suppose that can be done? Now I
      think Nanty Ewart, if he sails with the brig this morning tide, is the man
      to set him forward.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, aye, truly is he,&rsquo; said Job; &lsquo;never man knew the Border, dale and
      fell, pasture and ploughland, better than Nanty; and he can always bring
      him to the laird, too, if you are sure the gentleman&rsquo;s right. But indeed
      that&rsquo;s his own look-out; for were he the best man in Scotland, and the
      chairman of the d&mdash;d Board to boot, and had fifty men at his back, he
      were as well not visit the laird for anything but good. As for Nanty, he
      is word and blow, a d&mdash;d deal fiercer than Cristie Nixon that they
      keep such a din about. I have seen them both tried, by&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fairford now found himself called upon to say something; yet his feelings,
      upon finding himself thus completely in the power of a canting hypocrite,
      and of his retainer, who had so much the air of a determined ruffian,
      joined to the strong and abominable fume which they snuffed up with
      indifference, while it almost deprived him of respiration, combined to
      render utterance difficult. He stated, however, that he had no evil
      intentions towards the laird, as they called him, but was only the bearer
      of a letter to him on particular business, from Mr. Maxwell of
      Summertrees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, aye,&rsquo; said Job, &lsquo;that may be well enough; and if Mr. Trumbull is
      satisfied that the service is right, why, we will give you a cast in the
      JUMPING JENNY this tide, and Nanty Ewart will put you on a way of finding
      the laird, I warrant you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I may for the present return, I presume, to the inn where I left my
      horse?&rsquo; said Fairford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With pardon,&rsquo; replied Mr. Trumbull, &lsquo;you have been ower far ben with us
      for that; but Job will take you to a place where you may sleep rough till
      he calls you. I will bring you what little baggage you can need&mdash;for
      those who go on such errands must not be dainty. I will myself see after
      your horse, for a merciful man is merciful to his beast&mdash;a matter too
      often forgotten in our way of business.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, Master Trumbull,&rsquo; replied Job, &lsquo;you know that when we are chased,
      it&rsquo;s no time to shorten sail, and so the boys do ride whip and spur.&rsquo; He
      stopped in his speech, observing the old man had vanished through the door
      by which he had entered&mdash;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s always the way with old Turnpenny,&rsquo; 
      he said to Fairford; &lsquo;he cares for nothing of the trade but the profit&mdash;now,
      d&mdash;me, if I don&rsquo;t think the fun of it is better worth while. But come
      along, my fine chap; I must stow you away in safety until it is time to go
      aboard.&rsquo;

      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      NARRATIVE OF ALAN FAIRFORD, CONTINUED
    </h3>
    <p>
      Fairford followed his gruff guide among a labyrinth of barrels and
      puncheons, on which he had more than once like to have broken his nose,
      and from thence into what, by the glimpse of the passing lantern upon a
      desk and writing materials, seemed to be a small office for the dispatch
      of business. Here there appeared no exit; but the smuggler, or smuggler&rsquo;s
      ally, availing himself of a ladder, removed an old picture, which showed a
      door about seven feet from the ground, and Fairford, still following Job,
      was involved in another tortuous and dark passage, which involuntarily
      reminded him of Peter Peebles&rsquo;s lawsuit. At the end of this labyrinth,
      when he had little guess where he had been conducted, and was, according
      to the French phrase, totally DESORIENTE, Job suddenly set down the
      lantern, and availing himself of the flame to light two candles which
      stood on the table, asked if Alan would choose anything to eat,
      recommending, at all events, a slug of brandy to keep out the night air.
      Fairford declined both, but inquired after his baggage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The old master will take care of that himself,&rsquo; said Job Rutledge; and
      drawing back in the direction in which he had entered, he vanished from
      the farther end of the apartment, by a mode which the candles, still
      shedding an imperfect light, gave Alan no means of ascertaining. Thus the
      adventurous young lawyer was left alone in the apartment to which he had
      been conducted by so singular a passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this condition, it was Alan&rsquo;s first employment to survey, with some
      accuracy, the place where he was; and accordingly, having trimmed the
      lights, he walked slowly round the apartment, examining its appearance and
      dimensions. It seemed to be such a small dining-parlour as is usually
      found in the house of the better class of artisans, shopkeepers, and such
      persons, having a recess at the upper end, and the usual furniture of an
      ordinary description. He found a door, which he endeavoured to open, but
      it was locked on the outside. A corresponding door on the same side of the
      apartment admitted him into a closet, upon the front shelves of which were
      punch-bowls, glasses, tea-cups, and the like, while on one side was hung a
      horseman&rsquo;s greatcoat of the coarsest materials, with two great
      horse-pistols peeping out of the pocket, and on the floor stood a pair of
      well-spattered jack-boots, the usual equipment of the time, at least for
      long journeys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not greatly liking the contents of the closet, Alan Fairford shut the
      door, and resumed his scrutiny round the walls of the apartment, in order
      to discover the mode of Job Rutledge&rsquo;s retreat. The secret passage was,
      however, too artificially concealed, and the young lawyer had nothing
      better to do than to meditate on the singularity of his present situation.
      He had long known that the excise laws had occasioned an active contraband
      trade betwixt Scotland and England, which then, as now, existed, and will
      continue to exist until the utter abolition of the wretched system which
      establishes an inequality of duties betwixt the different parts of the
      same kingdom; a system, be it said in passing, mightily resembling the
      conduct of a pugilist, who should tie up one arm that he might fight the
      better with the other. But Fairford was unprepared for the expensive and
      regular establishments by which the illicit traffic was carried on, and
      could not have conceived that the capital employed in it should have been
      adequate to the erection of these extensive buildings, with all their
      contrivances for secrecy of communication. He was musing on these
      circumstances, not without some anxiety for the progress of his own
      journey, when suddenly, as he lifted his eyes, he discovered old Mr.
      Trumbull at the upper end of the apartment, bearing in one hand a small
      bundle, in the other his dark lantern, the light of which, as he advanced,
      he directed full upon Fairford&rsquo;s countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though such an apparition was exactly what he expected, yet he did not see
      the grim, stern old man present himself thus suddenly without emotion;
      especially when he recollected, what to a youth of his pious education was
      peculiarly shocking, that the grizzled hypocrite was probably that instant
      arisen from his knees to Heaven, for the purpose of engaging in the
      mysterious transactions of a desperate and illegal trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man, accustomed to judge with ready sharpness of the physiognomy
      of those with whom he had business, did not fail to remark something like
      agitation in Fairford&rsquo;s demeanour. &lsquo;Have ye taken the rue?&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Will
      ye take the sheaf from the mare, and give up the venture?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never!&rsquo; said Fairford, firmly, stimulated at once by his natural spirit,
      and the recollection of his friend; &lsquo;never, while I have life and strength
      to follow it out!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have brought you,&rsquo; said Trumbull, &lsquo;a clean shirt, and some stockings,
      which is all the baggage you can conveniently carry, and I will cause one
      of the lads lend you a horseman&rsquo;s coat, for it is ill sailing or riding
      without one; and, touching your valise, it will be as safe in my poor
      house, were it full of the gold of Ophir, as if it were in the depth of
      the mine.&rsquo; &lsquo;I have no doubt of it,&rsquo; said Fairford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now,&rsquo; said Trumbull, again, &lsquo;I pray you to tell me by what name I am
      to name you to Nanty (which is Antony) Ewart?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By the name of Alan Fairford,&rsquo; answered the young lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But that,&rsquo; said Mr. Trumbull, in reply, &lsquo;is your own proper name and
      surname.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what other should I give?&rsquo; said the young man; &lsquo;do you think I have
      any occasion for an alias? And, besides, Mr. Trumbull,&rsquo; added Alan,
      thinking a little raillery might intimate confidence of spirit, &lsquo;you
      blessed yourself, but a little while since, that you had no acquaintance
      with those who defiled their names so far as to be obliged to change
      them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;True, very true,&rsquo; said Mr. Trumbull; &lsquo;nevertheless, young man, my grey
      hairs stand unreproved in this matter; for, in my line of business, when I
      sit under my vine and my fig-tree, exchanging the strong waters of the
      north for the gold which is the price thereof, I have, I thank Heaven, no
      disguises to keep with any man, and wear my own name of Thomas Trumbull,
      without any chance that the same may be polluted. Whereas, thou, who art
      to journey in miry ways, and amongst a strange people, mayst do well to
      have two names, as thou hast two shirts, the one to keep the other clean.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he emitted a chuckling grunt, which lasted for two vibrations of the
      pendulum exactly, and was the only approach towards laughter in which old
      Turnpenny, as he was nicknamed, was ever known to indulge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are witty, Mr. Trumbull,&rsquo; said Fairford; &lsquo;but jests are no arguments&mdash;I
      shall keep my own name.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At your own pleasure,&rsquo; said the merchant; &lsquo;there is but one name which,&rsquo; 
      &amp;c. &amp;c, &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will not follow the hypocrite through the impious cant which he added,
      in order to close the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan followed him, in silent abhorrence, to the recess in which the
      beaufet was placed, and which was so artificially made as to conceal
      another of those traps with which the whole building abounded. This
      concealment admitted them to the same winding passage by which the young
      lawyer had been brought thither. The path which they now took amid these
      mazes, differed from the direction in which he had been guided by
      Rutledge. It led upwards, and terminated beneath a garret window. Trumbull
      opened it, and with more agility than his age promised, clambered out upon
      the leads. If Fairford&rsquo;s journey had been hitherto in a stifled and
      subterranean atmosphere, it was now open, lofty, and airy enough; for he
      had to follow his guide over leads and slates, which the old smuggler
      traversed with the dexterity of a cat. It is true, his course was
      facilitated by knowing exactly where certain stepping-places and holdfasts
      were placed, of which Fairford could not so readily avail himself; but,
      after a difficult and somewhat perilous progress along the roofs of two or
      three houses, they at length descended by a skylight into a garret room,
      and from thence by the stairs into a public-house; for such it appeared,
      by the ringing of bells, whistling for waiters and attendance, bawling of
      &lsquo;House, house, here!&rsquo; chorus of sea songs, and the like noises.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having descended to the second story, and entered a room there in which
      there was a light, old Mr. Trumbull rang the bell of the apartment thrice,
      with an interval betwixt each, during which he told deliberately the
      number twenty. Immediately after the third ringing the landlord appeared,
      with stealthy step, and an appearance of mystery on his buxom visage. He
      greeted Mr. Trumbull, who was his landlord as it proved, with great
      respect, and expressed some surprise at seeing him so late, as he termed
      it, &lsquo;on Saturday e&rsquo;en.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I, Robin Hastie,&rsquo; said the landlord to the tenant, am more surprised
      than pleased, to hear sae muckle din in your house, Robie, so near the
      honourable Sabbath; and I must mind you that it is contravening the terms
      of your tack, whilk stipulates that you should shut your public on
      Saturday at nine o&rsquo;clock, at latest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; said Robin Hastie, no way alarmed at the gravity of the
      rebuke, &lsquo;but you must take tent that I have admitted naebody but you, Mr.
      Trumbull (who by the way admitted yoursell), since nine o&rsquo;clock for the
      most of the folk have been here for several hours about the lading, and so
      on, of the brig. It is not full tide yet, and I cannot put the men out
      into the street. If I did, they would go to some other public, and their
      souls would be nane the better, and my purse muckle the waur; for how am I
      to pay the rent if I do not sell the liquor?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, then,&rsquo; said Thomas Trumbull, &lsquo;if it is a work of necessity, and in
      the honest independent way of business, no doubt there is balm in Gilead.
      But prithee, Robin, wilt thou see if Nanty Ewart be, as is most likely,
      amongst these unhappy topers; and if so, let him step this way cannily,
      and speak to me and this young gentleman. And it&rsquo;s dry talking, Robin&mdash;you
      must minister to us a bowl of punch&mdash;ye ken my gage.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From a mutchkin to a gallon, I ken your honour&rsquo;s taste, Mr. Thomas
      Trumbull,&rsquo; said mine host; &lsquo;and ye shall hang me over the signpost if
      there be a drap mair lemon or a curn less sugar than just suits you. There
      are three of you&mdash;you will be for the auld Scots peremptory
      pint-stoup for the success of the voyage?&rsquo; [The Scottish pint of liquid
      measure comprehends four English measures of the same denomination. The
      jest is well known of my poor countryman, who, driven to extremity by the
      raillery of the Southern, on the small denomination of the Scottish coin,
      at length answered, &lsquo;Aye, aye! But the deil tak them that has the LEAST
      PINT-STOUP.&lsquo;]
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Better pray for it than drink for it, Robin,&rsquo; said Mr. Trumbull. &lsquo;Yours
      is a dangerous trade, Robin; it hurts mony a ane&mdash;baith host and
      guest. But ye will get the blue bowl, Robin&mdash;the blue bowl&mdash;that
      will sloken all their drouth, and prevent the sinful repetition of
      whipping for an eke of a Saturday at e&rsquo;en. Aye, Robin, it is a pity of
      Nanty Ewart&mdash;Nanty likes the turning up of his little finger unco
      weel, and we maunna stint him, Robin, so as we leave him sense to steer
      by.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nanty Ewart could steer through the Pentland Firth though he were as
      drunk as the Baltic Ocean,&rsquo; said Robin Hastie; and instantly tripping
      downstairs, he speedily returned with the materials for what he called his
      BROWST, which consisted of two English quarts of spirits, in a huge blue
      bowl, with all the ingredients for punch in the same formidable
      proportion. At the same time he introduced Mr. Antony or Nanty Ewart,
      whose person, although he was a good deal flustered with liquor, was
      different from what Fairford expected. His dress was what is emphatically
      termed the shabby genteel&mdash;a frock with tarnished lace&mdash;a small
      cocked hat, ornamented in a similar way&mdash;a scarlet waistcoat, with
      faded embroidery, breeches of the same, with silver knee-bands, and he
      wore a smart hanger and a pair of pistols in a sullied swordbelt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here I come, patron,&rsquo; he said, shaking hands with Mr. Trumbull. &lsquo;Well, I
      see you have got some grog aboard.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not my custom, Mr. Ewart,&rsquo; said the old gentleman, &lsquo;as you well
      know, to become a chamberer or carouser thus late on Saturday at e&rsquo;en; but
      I wanted to recommend to your attention a young friend of ours, that is
      going upon a something particular journey, with a letter to our friend the
      Laird from Pate-in-Peril, as they call him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye&mdash;indeed?&mdash;he must be in high trust for so young a
      gentleman. I wish you joy, sir,&rsquo; bowing to Fairford. &lsquo;By&rsquo;r lady, as
      Shakespeare says, you are bringing up a neck for a fair end. Come, patron,
      we will drink to Mr. What-shall-call-um. What is his name? Did you tell
      me? And have I forgot it already.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Alan Fairford,&rsquo; said Trumbull.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, Mr. Alan Fairford&mdash;a good name for a fair trader&mdash;Mr. Alan
      Fairford; and may he be long withheld from the topmost round of ambition,
      which I take to be the highest round of a certain ladder.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      While he spoke, he seized the punch-ladle, and began to fill the glasses.
      But Mr. Trumbull arrested his hand, until he had, as he expressed himself,
      sanctified the liquor by a long grace; during the pronunciation of which
      he shut indeed his eyes, but his nostrils became dilated, as if he were
      snuffing up the fragrant beverage with peculiar complacency.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the grace was at length over, the three friends sat down to their
      beverage, and invited Alan Fairford to partake. Anxious about his
      situation, and disgusted as he was with his company, he craved, and with
      difficulty obtained permission, under the allegation of being fatigued,
      heated, and the like, to stretch himself on a couch which was in the
      apartment, and attempted at least to procure some rest before high-water,
      when the vessel was to sail.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was at length permitted to use his freedom, and stretched himself on
      the couch, having his eyes for some time fixed on the jovial party he had
      left, and straining his ears to catch if possible a little of their
      conversation. This he soon found was to no purpose for what did actually
      reach his ears was disguised so completely by the use of cant words and
      the thieves-latin called slang, that even when he caught the words, he
      found himself as far as ever from the sense of their conversation. At
      length he fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after Alan had slumbered for three or four hours, that he was
      wakened by voices bidding him rise up and prepare to be jogging. He
      started up accordingly, and found himself in presence of the same party of
      boon companions; who had just dispatched their huge bowl of punch. To
      Alan&rsquo;s surprise, the liquor had made but little innovation on the brains
      of men who were accustomed to drink at all hours, and in the most
      inordinate quantities. The landlord indeed spoke a little thick, and the
      texts of Mr. Thomas Trumbull stumbled on his tongue; but Nanty was one of
      those topers, who, becoming early what bon vivants term flustered, remain
      whole nights and days at the same point of intoxication; and, in fact, as
      they are seldom entirely sober, can be as rarely seen absolutely drunk.
      Indeed, Fairford, had he not known how Ewart had been engaged whilst he
      himself was asleep, would almost have sworn when he awoke, that the man
      was more sober than when he first entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was confirmed in this opinion when they descended below, where two or
      three sailors and ruffian-looking fellows awaited their commands. Ewart
      took the whole direction upon himself, gave his orders with briefness and
      precision, and looked to their being executed with the silence and
      celerity which that peculiar crisis required. All were now dismissed for
      the brig, which lay, as Fairford was given to understand, a little farther
      down the river, which is navigable for vessels of light burden till almost
      within a mile of the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they issued from the inn, the landlord bid them goodbye. Old Trumbull
      walked a little way with them, but the air had probably considerable
      effect on the state of his brain; for after reminding Alan Fairford that
      the next day was the honourable Sabbath, he became extremely excursive in
      an attempt to exhort him to keep it holy. At length, being perhaps
      sensible that he was becoming unintelligible, he thrust a volume into
      Fairford&rsquo;s hand&mdash;hiccuping at the same time&mdash;&lsquo;Good book&mdash;good
      book&mdash;fine hymn-book&mdash;fit for the honourable Sabbath, whilk
      awaits us to-morrow morning.&rsquo; Here the iron tongue of time told five from
      the town steeple of Annan, to the further confusion of Mr. Trumbull&rsquo;s
      already disordered ideas. &lsquo;Aye? Is Sunday come and gone already? Heaven be
      praised! Only it is a marvel the afternoon is sae dark for the time of the
      year&mdash;Sabbath has slipped ower quietly, but we have reason to bless
      oursells it has not been altogether misemployed. I heard little of the
      preaching&mdash;a cauld moralist, I doubt, served that out&mdash;but, eh&mdash;the
      prayer&mdash;I mind it as if I had said the words mysell.&rsquo; Here he
      repeated one or two petitions, which were probably a part of his family
      devotions, before he was summoned forth to what he called the way of
      business. &lsquo;I never remember a Sabbath pass so cannily off in my life.&rsquo; 
      Then he recollected himself a little, and said to Alan, &lsquo;You may read that
      book, Mr. Fairford, to-morrow, all the same, though it be Monday; for, you
      see, it was Saturday when we were thegither, and now it&rsquo;s Sunday and it&rsquo;s
      dark night&mdash;so the Sabbath has slipped clean away through our fingers
      like water through a sieve, which abideth not; and we have to begin again
      to-morrow morning, in the weariful, base, mean, earthly employments, whilk
      are unworthy of an immortal spirit&mdash;always excepting the way of
      business.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Three of the fellows were now returning to the town, and, at Ewart&rsquo;s
      command, they cut short the patriarch&rsquo;s exhortation, by leading him back
      to his own residence. The rest of the party then proceeded to the brig,
      which only waited their arrival to get under weigh and drop down the
      river. Nanty Ewart betook himself to steering the brig, and the very touch
      of the helm seemed to dispel the remaining influence of the liquor which
      he had drunk, since, through a troublesome and intricate channel, he was
      able to direct the course of his little vessel with the most perfect
      accuracy and safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan Fairford, for some time, availed himself of the clearness of the
      summer morning to gaze on the dimly seen shores betwixt which they glided,
      becoming less and less distinct as they receded from each other, until at
      length, having adjusted his little bundle by way of pillow, and wrapped
      around him the greatcoat with which old Trumbull had equipped him, he
      stretched himself on the deck, to try to recover the slumber out of which
      he had been awakened. Sleep had scarce begun to settle on his eyes, ere he
      found something stirring about his person. With ready presence of mind he
      recollected his situation, and resolved to show no alarm until the purpose
      of this became obvious; but he was soon relieved from his anxiety, by
      finding it was only the result of Nanty&rsquo;s attention to his comfort, who
      was wrapping around him, as softly as he could, a great boatcloak, in
      order to defend him from the morning air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thou art but a cockerel,&rsquo; he muttered, &lsquo;but &lsquo;twere pity thou wert knocked
      off the perch before seeing a little more of the sweet and sour of this
      world&mdash;though, faith, if thou hast the usual luck of it, the best way
      were to leave thee to the chance of a seasoning fever.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      These words, and the awkward courtesy with which the skipper of the little
      brig tucked the sea-coat round Fairford, gave him a confidence of safety
      which he had not yet thoroughly possessed. He stretched himself in more
      security on the hard planks, and was speedily asleep, though his slumbers
      were feverish and unrefreshing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been elsewhere intimated that Alan Fairford inherited from his
      mother a delicate constitution, with a tendency to consumption; and, being
      an only child, with such a cause for apprehension, care, to the verge of
      effeminacy, was taken to preserve him from damp beds, wet feet, and those
      various emergencies to which the Caledonian boys of much higher birth, but
      more active habits, are generally accustomed. In man, the spirit sustains
      the constitutional weakness, as in the winged tribes the feathers bear
      aloft the body. But there is a bound to these supporting qualities; and as
      the pinions of the bird must at length grow weary, so the VIS ANIMI of the
      human struggler becomes broken down by continued fatigue.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the voyager was awakened by the light of the sun now riding high in
      heaven, he found himself under the influence of an almost intolerable
      headache, with heat, thirst, shooting across the back and loins, and other
      symptoms intimating violent cold, accompanied with fever. The manner in
      which he had passed the preceding day and night, though perhaps it might
      have been of little consequence to most young men, was to him, delicate in
      constitution and nurture, attended with bad and even perilous
      consequences. He felt this was the case, yet would fain have combated the
      symptoms of indisposition, which, indeed, he imputed chiefly to
      sea-sickness. He sat up on deck, and looked on the scene around, as the
      little vessel, having borne down the Solway Firth, was beginning, with a
      favourable northerly breeze, to bear away to the southward, crossing the
      entrance of the Wampool river, and preparing to double the most northerly
      point of Cumberland.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Fairford felt annoyed with deadly sickness, as well as by pain of a
      distressing and oppressive character; and neither Criffel, rising in
      majesty on the one hand, nor the distant yet more picturesque outline of
      Skiddaw and Glaramara upon the other, could attract his attention in the
      manner in which it was usually fixed by beautiful scenery, and especially
      that which had in it something new as well as striking. Yet it was not in
      Alan Fairford&rsquo;s nature to give way to despondence, even when seconded by
      pain. He had recourse, in the first place, to his pocket; but instead of
      the little Sallust he had brought with him, that the perusal of a
      classical author might help to pass away a heavy hour, he pulled out the
      supposed hymn-book with which he had been presented a few hours before, by
      that temperate and scrupulous person, Mr. Thomas Trumbull, ALIAS
      Turnpenny. The volume was bound in sable, and its exterior might have
      become a psalter. But what was Alan&rsquo;s astonishment to read on the title
      page the following words:&mdash;&lsquo;Merry Thoughts for Merry Men; or Mother
      Midnight&rsquo;s Miscellany for the Small Hours;&rsquo; and turning over the leaves,
      he was disgusted with profligate tales, and more profligate songs,
      ornamented with figures corresponding in infamy with the letterpress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good God!&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;and did this hoary reprobate summon his family
      together, and, with such a disgraceful pledge of infamy in his bosom,
      venture to approach the throne of his Creator? It must be so; the book is
      bound after the manner of those dedicated to devotional subjects, and
      doubtless the wretch, in his intoxication, confounded the books he carried
      with him, as he did the days of the week.&rsquo; Seized with the disgust with
      which the young and generous usually regard the vices of advanced life,
      Alan, having turned the leaves of the book over in hasty disdain, flung it
      from him, as far as he could, into the sea. He then had recourse to the
      Sallust, which he had at first sought for in vain. As he opened the book,
      Nanty Ewart, who had been looking over his shoulder, made his own opinion
      heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think now, brother, if you are so much scandalized at a little piece of
      sculduddery, which, after all, does nobody any harm, you had better have
      given it to me than have flung it into the Solway.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope, sir,&rsquo; answered Fairford, civilly, &lsquo;you are in the habit of
      reading better books.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Faith,&rsquo; answered Nanty, &lsquo;with help of a little Geneva text, I could read
      my Sallust as well as you can;&rsquo; and snatching the book from Alan&rsquo;s hand,
      he began to read, in the Scottish accent:&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;IGITUR EX DIVITIIS
      JUVENTUTEM LUXURIA ATQUE AVARITIA CUM SUPERBILI INVASERE: RAPERE,
      CONSUMERE; SUA PARVI PENDERE, ALIENA CUPERE; PUDOREM, AMICITIAM,
      PUDICITIAM, DIVINA ATQUE HUMANA PROMISCUA, NIHIL PENSI NEQUE MODERATI
      HABERE.&rdquo; [The translation of the passage is thus given by Sir Henry
      Steuart of Allanton:&mdash;&lsquo;The youth, taught to look up to riches as the
      sovereign good, became apt pupils in the school of Luxury. Rapacity and
      profusion went hand in hand. Careless of their own fortunes, and eager to
      possess those of others, shame and remorse, modesty and moderation, every
      principle gave way.&rsquo;&mdash;WORKS OF SALLUST, WITH ORIGINAL ESSAYS, vol.
      ii. p.17.]&mdash;There is a slap in the face now, for an honest fellow
      that has been buccaneering! Never could keep a groat of what he got, or
      hold his fingers from what belonged to another, said you? Fie, fie, friend
      Crispus, thy morals are as crabbed and austere as thy style&mdash;the one
      has as little mercy as the other has grace. By my soul, it is unhandsome
      to make personal reflections on an old acquaintance, who seeks a little
      civil intercourse with you after nigh twenty years&rsquo; separation. On my
      soul, Master Sallust deserves to float on the Solway better than Mother
      Midnight herself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps, in some respects, he may merit better usage at our hands,&rsquo; said
      Alan; &lsquo;for if he has described vice plainly, it seems to have been for the
      purpose of rendering it generally abhorred.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the seaman, &lsquo;I have heard of the Sortes Virgilianae, and I
      dare say the Sortes Sallustianae are as true every tittle. I have
      consulted honest Crispus on my own account, and have had a cuff for my
      pains. But now see, I open the book on your behalf, and behold what occurs
      first to my eye!&mdash;Lo you there&mdash;&ldquo;CATILINA ... OMNIUM
      FLAGITIOSORUM ATQUE FACINOROSORUM CIRCUM SE HABEBAT.&rdquo; And then again&mdash;&ldquo;ETIAM
      SI QUIS A CULPA VACUUS IN AMICITIAM EJUS INCIDIDERAT QUOTIDIANO USU PAR
      SIMILISQUE CAETERIS EFFICIEBATUR.&rdquo; [After enumerating the evil qualities
      of Catiline&rsquo;s associates, the author adds, &lsquo;If it happened that any as yet
      uncontaminated by vice were fatally drawn into his friendship, the effects
      of intercourse and snares artfully spread, subdued every scruple, and
      early assimilated them to their conductors.&rsquo;&mdash;Ibidem, p. 19.] That is
      what I call plain speaking on the part of the old Roman, Mr. Fairford. By
      the way, that is a capital name for a lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lawyer as I am,&rsquo; said Fairford, &lsquo;I do not understand your innuendo.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, then,&rsquo; said Ewart, &lsquo;I can try it another way, as well as the
      hypocritical old rascal Turnpenny himself could do. I would have you to
      know that I am well acquainted with my Bible-book, as well as with my
      friend Sallust.&rsquo; He then, in a snuffling and canting tone, began to repeat
      the Scriptural text&mdash;&lsquo;"DAVID THEREFORE DEPARTED THENCE, AND WENT TO
      THE CAVE OF ADULLAM. AND EVERY ONE THAT WAS IN DISTRESS, AND EVERY ONE
      THAT WAS IN DEBT, AND EVERY ONE THAT WAS DISCONTENTED, GATHERED THEMSELVES
      TOGETHER UNTO HIM, AND HE BECAME A CAPTAIN OVER THEM.&rdquo; What think you of
      that?&rsquo; he said, suddenly changing his manner. &lsquo;Have I touched you now,
      sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are as far off as ever,&rsquo; replied Fairford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What the devil! and you a repeating frigate between Summertrees and the
      laird! Tell that to the marines&mdash;the sailors won&rsquo;t believe it. But
      you are right to be cautious, since you can&rsquo;t say who are right, who not.
      But you look ill; it&rsquo;s but the cold morning air. Will you have a can of
      flip, or a jorum of hot rumbo? or will you splice the mainbrace&rsquo; (showing
      a spirit-flask). &lsquo;Will you have a quid&mdash;or a pipe&mdash;or a cigar?&mdash;a
      pinch of snuff, at least, to clear your brains and sharpen your
      apprehension?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fairford rejected all these friendly propositions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, then,&rsquo; continued Ewart, &lsquo;if you will do nothing for the free trade,
      I must patronize it myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he took a large glass of brandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A hair of the dog that bit me,&rsquo; he continued,&mdash;&lsquo;of the dog that will
      worry me one day soon; and yet, and be d&mdash;d to me for an idiot, I
      must always have hint at my throat. But, says the old catch&rsquo;&mdash;Here he
      sang, and sang well&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s drink&mdash;let&rsquo;s drink&mdash;while life we have;
   We&rsquo;ll find but cold drinking, cold drinking in the grave.
</pre>
    <p>
      All this,&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;is no charm against the headache. I wish I had
      anything that could do you good. Faith, and we have tea and coffee aboard!
      I&rsquo;ll open a chest or a bag, and let you have some in an instant. You are
      at the age to like such catlap better than better stuff.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fairford thanked him, and accepted his offer of tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nanty Ewart was soon heard calling about, &lsquo;Break open yon chest&mdash;take
      out your capful, you bastard of a powder-monkey; we may want it again. No
      sugar? all used up for grog, say you? knock another loaf to pieces, can&rsquo;t
      ye? and get the kettle boiling, ye hell&rsquo;s baby, in no time at all!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      By dint of these energetic proceedings he was in a short time able to
      return to the place where his passenger lay sick and exhausted, with a
      cup, or rather a canful, of tea; for everything was on a large scale on
      board of the JUMPING JENNY. Alan drank it eagerly, and with so much
      appearance of being refreshed that Nanty Ewart swore he would have some
      too, and only laced it, as his phrase went, with a single glass of brandy.

      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      NARRATIVE OF ALAN FAIRFORD, CONTINUED
    </h3>
    <p>
      We left Alan Fairford on the deck of the little smuggling brig, in that
      disconsolate situation, when sickness and nausea, attack a heated and
      fevered frame, and an anxious mind. His share of sea-sickness, however,
      was not so great as to engross his sensations entirely, or altogether to
      divert his attention from what was passing around. If he could not delight
      in the swiftness and agility with which the &lsquo;little frigate&rsquo; walked the
      waves, or amuse himself by noticing the beauty of the sea-views around
      him, where the distant Skiddaw raised his brow, as if in defiance of the
      clouded eminence of Criffel, which lorded it over the Scottish side of the
      estuary, he had spirits and composure enough to pay particular attention
      to the master of the vessel, on whose character his own safety in all
      probability was dependent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nanty Ewart had now given the helm to one of his people, a bald-pated,
      grizzled old fellow, whose whole life had been spent in evading the
      revenue laws, with now and then the relaxation of a few months&rsquo; 
      imprisonment, for deforcing officers, resisting seizures, and the like
      offences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nanty himself sat down by Fairford, helped him to his tea, with such other
      refreshments as he could think of, and seemed in his way sincerely
      desirous to make his situation as comfortable as things admitted. Fairford
      had thus an opportunity to study his countenance and manners more closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was plain, Ewart, though a good seaman, had not been bred upon that
      element. He was a reasonably good scholar, and seemed fond of showing it
      by recurring to the subject of Sallust and Juvenal; while, on the other
      hand, sea-phrases seldom chequered his conversation. He had been in person
      what is called a smart little man; but the tropical sun had burnt his
      originally fair complexion to a dusty red; and the bile which was diffused
      through his system, had stained it with a yellowish black&mdash;what ought
      to have been the white part of his eyes, in particular, had a hue as deep
      as the topaz. He was very thin, or rather emaciated, and his countenance,
      though still indicating alertness and activity, showed a constitution
      exhausted with excessive use of his favourite stimulus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see you look at me hard,&rsquo; said he to Fairford. &lsquo;Had you been an officer
      of the d&mdash;d customs, my terriers&rsquo; backs would have been up. He opened
      his breast, and showed Alan a pair of pistols disposed between his
      waistcoat and jacket, placing his finger at the same time upon the cock of
      one of them. &lsquo;But come, you are an honest fellow, though you&rsquo;re a close
      one. I dare say you think me a queer customer; but I can tell you, they
      that see the ship leave harbour know little of the seas she is to sail
      through. My father, honest old gentleman, never would have thought to see
      me master of the JUMPING JENNY.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fairford said, it seemed very clear indeed that Mr. Ewart&rsquo;s education was
      far superior to the line he at present occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Criffel to Solway Moss!&rsquo; said the other. Why, man, I should have been
      an expounder of the word, with a wig like a snow-wreath, and a stipend
      like&mdash;like&mdash;like a hundred pounds a year, I suppose. I can spend
      thrice as much as that, though, being such as I am. Here he sang a scrap
      of an old Northumbrian ditty, mimicking the burr of the natives of that
      county:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;Willy Foster&rsquo;s gone to sea,
   Siller buckles at his knee,
   He&rsquo;ll come back and marry me&mdash;
              Canny Willy Foster.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no doubt,&rsquo; said Fairford, &lsquo;your present occupation is more
      lucrative; &lsquo;but I should have thought the Church might have been more&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, recollecting that it was not his business to say anything
      disagreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;More respectable, you mean, I suppose?&rsquo; said Ewart, with a sneer, and
      squirting the tobacco-juice through his front teeth; then was silent for a
      moment, and proceeded in a tone of candour which some internal touch of
      conscience dictated. &lsquo;And so it would, Mr. Fairford&mdash;and happier,
      too, by a thousand degrees&mdash;though I have had my pleasures too. But
      there was my father (God bless the old man!) a true chip of the old
      Presbyterian block, walked his parish like a captain on the quarterdeck,
      and was always ready to do good to rich and poor&mdash;Off went the
      laird&rsquo;s hat to the minister, as fast as the poor man&rsquo;s bonnet. When the
      eye saw him&mdash;Pshaw! what have I to do with that now?&mdash;Yes, he
      was, as Virgil hath it, &ldquo;VIR SAPIENTIA ET PIETATE GRAVIS.&rdquo; But he might
      have been the wiser man, had he kept me at home, when he sent me at
      nineteen to study Divinity at the head of the highest stair in the
      Covenant Close. It was a cursed mistake in the old gentleman. What though
      Mrs. Cantrips of Kittlebasket (for she wrote herself no less) was our
      cousin five times removed, and took me on that account to board and
      lodging at six shillings instead of seven shillings a week? it was a d&mdash;d
      bad saving, as the case proved. Yet her very dignity might have kept me in
      order; for she never read a chapter excepting out of a Cambridge Bible,
      printed by Daniel, and bound in embroidered velvet. I think I see it at
      this moment! And on Sundays, when we had a quart of twopenny ale, instead
      of butter-milk, to our porridge, it was always served up in a silver
      posset-dish. Also she used silver-mounted spectacles, whereas even my
      father&rsquo;s were cased in mere horn. These things had their impression at
      first, but we get used to grandeur by degrees. Well, sir!&mdash;Gad, I can
      scarce get on with my story&mdash;it sticks in my throat&mdash;must take a
      trifle to wash it down. Well, this dame had a daughter&mdash;Jess
      Cantrips, a black-eyed, bouncing wench&mdash;and, as the devil would have
      it, there was the d&mdash;d five-story stair&mdash;her foot was never from
      it, whether I went out or came home from the Divinity Hall. I would have
      eschewed her, sir&mdash;I would, on my soul; for I was as innocent a lad
      as ever came from Lammermuir; but there was no possibility of escape,
      retreat, or flight, unless I could have got a pair of wings, or made use
      of a ladder seven stories high, to scale the window of my attic. It
      signifies little talking&mdash;you may suppose how all this was to end&mdash;I
      would have married the girl, and taken my chance&mdash;I would, by Heaven!
      for she was a pretty girl, and a good girl, till she and I met; but you
      know the old song, &ldquo;Kirk would not let us be.&rdquo; A gentleman, in my case,
      would have settled the matter with the kirk-treasurer for a small sum of
      money; but the poor stibbler, the penniless dominie, having married his
      cousin of Kittlebasket, must next have proclaimed her frailty to the whole
      parish, by mounting the throne of Presbyterian penance, and proving, as
      Othello says, &ldquo;his love a whore,&rdquo; in face of the whole congregation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In this extremity I dared not stay where I was, and so thought to go home
      to my father. But first I got Jack Radaway, a lad from the same parish,
      and who lived in the same infernal stair, to make some inquiries how the
      old gentleman had taken the matter. I soon, by way of answer, learned, to
      the great increase of my comfortable reflections, that the good old man
      made as much clamour as if such a thing as a man&rsquo;s eating his wedding
      dinner without saying grace had never happened since Adam&rsquo;s time. He did
      nothing for six days but cry out, &ldquo;Ichabod, Ichabod, the glory is departed
      from my house!&rdquo; and on the seventh he preached a sermon, in which he
      enlarged on this incident as illustrative of one of the great occasions
      for humiliation, and causes of national defection. I hope the course he
      took comforted himself&mdash;I am sure it made me ashamed to show my nose
      at home. So I went down to Leith, and, exchanging my hoddin grey coat of
      my mother&rsquo;s spinning for such a jacket as this, I entered my name at the
      rendezvous as an able-bodied landsman, and sailed with the tender round to
      Plymouth, where they were fitting out a squadron for the West Indies.
      There I was put aboard the FEARNOUGHT, Captain Daredevil&mdash;among whose
      crew I soon learned to fear Satan (the terror of my early youth) as little
      as the toughest Jack on board. I had some qualms at first, but I took the
      remedy&rsquo; (tapping the case-bottle) &lsquo;which I recommend to you, being as good
      for sickness of the soul as for sickness of the stomach&mdash;What, you
      won&rsquo;t?&mdash;very well, I must, then&mdash;here is to ye.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You would, I am afraid, find your education of little use in your new
      condition?&rsquo; said Fairford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pardon me, sir,&rsquo; resumed the captain of the JUMPING JENNY; &lsquo;my handful of
      Latin, and small pinch of Greek, were as useless as old junk, to be sure;
      but my reading, writing and accompting, stood me in good stead, and
      brought me forward; I might have been schoolmaster&mdash;aye, and master,
      in time; but that valiant liquor, rum, made a conquest of me rather too
      often, and so, make what sail I could, I always went to leeward. We were
      four years broiling in that blasted climate, and I came back at last with
      a little prize-money. I always had thoughts of putting things to rights in
      the Covenant Close, and reconciling myself to my father. I found out Jack
      Hadaway, who was TUPTOWING away with a dozen of wretched boys, and a fine
      string of stories he had ready to regale my ears withal. My father had
      lectured on what he called &ldquo;my falling away,&rdquo; for seven Sabbaths, when,
      just as his parishioners began to hope that the course was at an end, he
      was found dead in his bed on the eighth Sunday morning. Jack Hadaway
      assured me, that if I wished to atone for my errors, by undergoing the
      fate of the first martyr, I had only to go to my native village, where the
      very stones of the street would rise up against me as my father&rsquo;s
      murderer. Here was a pretty item&mdash;well, my tongue clove to my mouth
      for an hour, and was only able at last to utter the name of Mrs. Cantrips.
      Oh, this was a new theme for my Job&rsquo;s comforter. My sudden departure&mdash;my
      father&rsquo;s no less sudden death&mdash;had prevented the payment of the
      arrears of my board and lodging&mdash;the landlord was a haberdasher, with
      a heart as rotten as the muslin wares he dealt in. Without respect to her
      age or gentle kin, my Lady Kittlebasket was ejected from her airy
      habitation&mdash;her porridge-pot, silver posset-dish, silver-mounted
      spectacles, and Daniel&rsquo;s Cambridge Bible, sold, at the Cross of Edinburgh,
      to the caddie who would bid highest for them, and she herself driven to
      the workhouse, where she got in with difficulty, but was easily enough
      lifted out, at the end of the month, as dead as her friends could desire.
      Merry tidings this to me, who had been the d&mdash;&mdash;d&rsquo; (he paused a
      moment) &lsquo;ORIGO MALI&mdash;Gad, I think my confession would sound better in
      Latin than in English!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But the best jest was behind&mdash;I had just power to stammer out
      something about Jess&mdash;by my faith he HAD an answer! I had taught Jess
      one trade, and, like a prudent girl, she had found out another for
      herself; unluckily, they were both contraband, and Jess Cantrips, daughter
      of the Lady Kittlebasket, had the honour to be transported to the
      plantations, for street-walking and pocket-picking, about six months
      before I touched shore.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He changed the bitter tone of affected pleasantry into an attempt to
      laugh, then drew his swarthy hand across his swarthy eyes, and said in a
      more natural accent, &lsquo;Poor Jess!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause&mdash;until Fairford, pitying the poor man&rsquo;s state of
      mind, and believing he saw something in him that, but for early error and
      subsequent profligacy, might have been excellent and noble, helped on the
      conversation by asking, in a tone of commiseration, how he had been able
      to endure such a load of calamity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, very well,&rsquo; answered the seaman; &lsquo;exceedingly well&mdash;like a
      tight ship in a brisk gale. Let me recollect. I remember thanking Jack,
      very composedly, for the interesting and agreeable communication; I then
      pulled out my canvas pouch, with my hoard of moidores, and taking out two
      pieces, I bid Jack keep the rest till I came back, as I was for a cruise
      about Auld Reekie. The poor devil looked anxiously, but I shook him by the
      hand, and ran downstairs, in such confusion of mind, that notwithstanding
      what I had heard, I expected to meet Jess at every turning.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was market-day, and the usual number of rogues and fools were assembled
      at the Cross. I observed everybody looked strange on me, and I thought
      some laughed. I fancy I had been making queer faces enough, and perhaps
      talking to myself, When I saw myself used in this manner, I held out my
      clenched fists straight before me, stooped my head, and, like a ram when
      he makes his race, darted off right down the street, scattering groups of
      weatherbeaten lairds and periwigged burgesses, and bearing down all before
      me. I heard the cry of &ldquo;Seize the madman!&rdquo; echoed, in Celtic sounds, from
      the City Guard, with &ldquo;Ceaze ta matman!&rdquo;&mdash;but pursuit and opposition
      were in vain. I pursued my career; the smell of the sea, I suppose, led me
      to Leith, where, soon after, I found myself walking very quietly on the
      shore, admiring the tough round and sound cordage of the vessels, and
      thinking how a loop, with a man at the end of one of them, would look, by
      way of tassel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was opposite to the rendezvous, formerly my place of refuge&mdash;in I
      bolted&mdash;found one or two old acquaintances, made half a dozen new
      ones&mdash;drank for two days&mdash;was put aboard the tender&mdash;off to
      Portsmouth&mdash;then landed at the Haslar hospital in a fine hissing-hot
      fever. Never mind&mdash;I got better&mdash;nothing can kill me&mdash;the
      West Indies were my lot again, for since I did not go where I deserved in
      the next world, I had something as like such quarters as can be had in
      this&mdash;black devils for inhabitants&mdash;flames and earthquakes, and
      so forth, for your element. Well, brother, something or other I did or
      said&mdash;I can&rsquo;t tell what&mdash;How the devil should I, when I was as
      drunk as David&rsquo;s sow, you know? But I was punished, my lad&mdash;made to
      kiss the wench that never speaks but when she scolds, and that&rsquo;s the
      gunner&rsquo;s daughter, comrade. Yes, the minister&rsquo;s son of no matter where&mdash;has
      the cat&rsquo;s scratch on his back! This roused me, and when we were ashore
      with the boat, I gave three inches of the dirk, after a stout tussle, to
      the fellow I blamed most, and took the bush for it. There were plenty of
      wild lads then along shore&mdash;and, I don&rsquo;t care who knows&mdash;I went
      on the account, look you&mdash;sailed under the black flag and
      marrow-bones&mdash;was a good friend to the sea, and an enemy to all that
      sailed on it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fairford, though uneasy in his mind at finding himself, a lawyer, so close
      to a character so lawless, thought it best, nevertheless, to put a good
      face on the matter, and asked Mr. Ewart, with as much unconcern as he
      could assume, &lsquo;whether he was fortunate as a rover?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no&mdash;d&mdash;n it, no,&rsquo; replied Nanty; &lsquo;the devil a crumb of
      butter was ever churned that would stick upon my bread. There was no order
      among us&mdash;he that was captain to-day, was swabber to-morrow; and as
      for plunder&mdash;they say old Avery, and one or two close hunks, made
      money; but in my time, all went as it came; and reason good, for if a
      fellow had saved five dollars, his throat would have been cut in his
      hammock. And then it was a cruel, bloody work.&mdash;Pah,&mdash;we&rsquo;ll say
      no more about it. I broke with them at last, for what they did on board of
      a bit of a snow&mdash;no matter what it was bad enough, since it
      frightened me&mdash;I took French leave, and came in upon the
      proclamation, so I am free of all that business. And here I sit, the
      skipper of the JUMPING JENNY&mdash;a nutshell of a thing, but goes through
      the water like a dolphin. If it were not for yon hypocritical scoundrel at
      Annan, who has the best end of the profit, and takes none of the risk, I
      should be well enough&mdash;as well as I want to be. Here is no lack of my
      best friend,&rsquo;&mdash;touching his case-bottle;&mdash;&lsquo;but, to tell you a
      secret, he and I have got so used to each other, I begin to think he is
      like a professed joker, that makes your sides sore with laughing if you
      see him but now and then; but if you take up house with him, he can only
      make your head stupid. But I warrant the old fellow is doing the best he
      can for me, after all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what may that be?&rsquo; said Fairford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is KILLING me,&rsquo; replied Nanty Ewart; &lsquo;and I am only sorry he is so
      long about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying he jumped on his feet, and, tripping up and down the deck, gave
      his orders with his usual clearness and decision, notwithstanding the
      considerable quantity of spirits which he had contrived to swallow while
      recounting his history.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although far from feeling well, Fairford endeavoured to rouse himself and
      walk to the head of the brig, to enjoy the beautiful prospect, as well as
      to take some note of the course which the vessel held. To his great
      surprise, instead of standing across to the opposite shore from which she
      had departed, the brig was going down the Firth, and apparently steering
      into the Irish Sea. He called to Nanty Ewart, and expressed his surprise
      at the course they were pursuing, and asked why they did not stand
      straight across the Firth for some port in Cumberland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, this is what I call a reasonable question, now,&rsquo; answered Nanty; &lsquo;as
      if a ship could go as straight to its port as a horse to the stable, or a
      free-trader could sail the Solway as securely as a King&rsquo;s cutter! Why,
      I&rsquo;ll tell ye, brother&mdash;if I do not see a smoke on Bowness, that is
      the village upon the headland yonder, I must stand out to sea for
      twenty-four hours at least, for we must keep the weather-gage if there are
      hawks abroad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And if you do see the signal of safety, Master Ewart, what is to be done
      then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why then, and in that case, I must keep off till night, and then run you,
      with the kegs and the rest of the lumber, ashore at Skinburness,&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And then I am to meet with this same laird whom I have the letter for?&rsquo; 
      continued Fairford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That,&rsquo; said Ewart, &lsquo;is thereafter as it may be; the ship has its course&mdash;the
      fair trader has his port&mdash;but it is not easy to say where the laird
      may be found. But he will be within twenty miles of us, off or on&mdash;and
      it will be my business to guide you to him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fairford could not withstand the passing impulse of terror which crossed
      him, when thus reminded that he was so absolutely in the power of a man,
      who, by his own account, had been a pirate, and who was at present, in all
      probability, an outlaw as well as a contraband trader. Nanty Ewart guessed
      the cause of his involuntary shuddering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What the devil should I gain,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;by passing so poor a card as you
      are? Have I not had ace of trumps in my hand, and did I not play it
      fairly? Aye, I say the JUMPING JENNY can run in other ware as well as
      kegs. Put SIGMA and TAU to Ewart, and see how that will spell&mdash;D&rsquo;ye
      take me now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No indeed,&rsquo; said Fairford; &lsquo;I am utterly ignorant of what you allude to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, by Jove!&rsquo; said Nanty Ewart, &lsquo;thou art either the deepest or the
      shallowest fellow I ever met with&mdash;or you are not right after all. I
      wonder where Summertrees could pick up such a tender along-shore. Will you
      let me see his letter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fairford did not hesitate to gratify his wish, which, he was aware, he
      could not easily resist. The master of the JUMPING JENNY looked at the
      direction very attentively, then turned the letter to and fro, and
      examined each flourish of the pen, as if he were judging of a piece of
      ornamented manuscript; then handled it back to Fairford, without a single
      word of remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Am I right now?&rsquo; said the young lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, for that matter,&rsquo; answered Nanty, &lsquo;the letter is right, sure enough;
      but whether you are right or not, is your own business rather than mine.&rsquo; 
      And, striking upon a flint with the back of a knife, he kindled a cigar as
      thick as his finger, and began to smoke away with great perseverance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan Fairford continued to regard him with a melancholy feeling, divided
      betwixt the interest he took in the unhappy man, and a not unnatural
      apprehension for the issue of his own adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ewart, notwithstanding the stupefying nature of his pastime, seemed to
      guess what was working in his passenger&rsquo;s mind; for, after they had
      remained some time engaged in silently observing each other, he suddenly
      dashed his cigar on the deck, and said to him, &lsquo;Well then, if you are
      sorry for me, I am sorry for you. D&mdash;n me, if I have cared a button
      for man or mother&rsquo;s son, since two years since when I had another peep of
      Jack Hadaway. &lsquo;The fellow was got as fat as a Norway whale&mdash;married
      to a great Dutch-built quean that had brought him six children. I believe
      he did not know me, and thought I was come to rob his house; however, I
      made up a poor face, and told him who I was. Poor Jack would have given me
      shelter and clothes, and began to tell me of the moidores that were in
      bank, when I wanted them. Egad, he changed his note when I told him what
      my life had been, and only wanted to pay me my cash and get rid of me. I
      never saw so terrified a visage. I burst out a-laughing in his face, told
      him it was all a humbug, and that the moidores were all his own,
      henceforth and for ever, and so ran off. I caused one of our people send
      him a bag of tea and a keg of brandy, before I left&mdash;poor Jack! I
      think you are the second person these ten years, that has cared a
      tobacco-stopper for Nanty Ewart.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps, Mr. Ewart,&rsquo; said Fairford, &lsquo;you live chiefly with men too deeply
      interested for their own immediate safety, to think much upon the distress
      of others?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And with whom do you yourself consort, I pray?&rsquo; replied Nanty, smartly.
      &lsquo;Why, with plotters, that can make no plot to better purpose than their
      own hanging; and incendiaries, that are snapping the flint upon wet
      tinder. You&rsquo;ll as soon raise the dead as raise the Highlands&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
      as soon get a grunt from a dead sow as any comfort from Wales or Cheshire.
      You think because the pot is boiling, that no scum but yours can come
      uppermost&mdash;I know better, by&mdash;. All these rackets and riots that
      you think are trending your way have no relation at all to your interest;
      and the best way to make the whole kingdom friends again at once, would be
      the alarm of such an undertaking as these mad old fellows are trying to
      launch into.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I really am not in such secrets as you seem to allude to,&rsquo; said Fairford;
      and, determined at the same time to avail himself as far as possible of
      Nanty&rsquo;s communicative disposition, he added, with a smile,&rsquo; And if I were,
      I should not hold it prudent to make them much the subject of
      conversation. But I am sure, so sensible a man as Summertrees and the
      laird may correspond together without offence to the state.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I take you, friend&mdash;I take you,&rsquo; said Nanty Ewart, upon whom, at
      length, the liquor and tobacco-smoke began to make considerable
      innovation. &lsquo;As to what gentlemen may or may not correspond about, why we
      may pretermit the question, as the old professor used to say at the Hall;
      and as to Summertrees, I will say nothing, knowing him to be an old fox.
      But I say that this fellow the laird is a firebrand in the country; that
      he is stirring up all the honest fellows who should be drinking their
      brandy quietly, by telling them stories about their ancestors and the
      Forty-five; and that he is trying to turn all waters into his own
      mill-dam, and to set his sails to all winds. And because the London people
      are roaring about for some pinches of their own, he thinks to win them to
      his turn with a wet finger. And he gets encouragement from some, because
      they want a spell of money from him; and from others, because they fought
      for the cause once and are ashamed to go back; and others, because they
      have nothing to lose; and others, because they are discontented fools. But
      if he has brought you, or any one, I say not whom, into this scrape, with
      the hope of doing any good, he&rsquo;s a d&mdash;d decoy-duck, and that&rsquo;s all I
      can say for him; and you are geese, which is worse than being decoy-ducks,
      or lame-ducks either. And so here is to the prosperity of King George the
      Third, and the true Presbyterian religion, and confusion to the Pope, the
      Devil, and the Pretender! I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Mr. Fairbairn, I am but
      tenth owner of this bit of a craft, the JUMPING JENNY&mdash;but tenth
      owner and must sail her by my owners&rsquo; directions. But if I were whole
      owner, I would not have the brig be made a ferry-boat for your
      Jacobitical, old-fashioned Popish riff-raff, Mr. Fairport&mdash;I would
      not, by my soul; they should walk the plank, by the gods, as I have seen
      better men do when I sailed under the What-d&rsquo;ye-callum colours. But being
      contraband goods, and on board my vessel, and I with my sailing orders in
      my hand, why, I am to forward them as directed&mdash;I say, John Roberts,
      keep her up a bit with the helm.&mdash;and so, Mr. Fairweather, what I do
      is&mdash;as the d&mdash;d villain Turnpenny says&mdash;all in the way of
      business.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been speaking with difficulty for the last five minutes, and now at
      length dropped on the deck, fairly silenced by the quantity of spirits
      which he had swallowed, but without having showed any glimpse of the
      gaiety, or even of the extravagance, of intoxication.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old sailor stepped forward and flung a sea-cloak over the slumberer&rsquo;s
      shoulders, and added, looking at Fairford, &lsquo;Pity of him he should have
      this fault; for without it, he would have been as clever a fellow as ever
      trod a plank with ox leather.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what are we to do now?&rsquo; said Fairford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stand off and on, to be sure, till we see the signal, and then obey
      orders.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the old man turned to his duty, and left the passenger to amuse
      himself with his own meditations. Presently afterward a light column of
      smoke was seen rising from the little headland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can tell you what we are to do now, master,&rsquo; said the sailor. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll
      stand out to sea, and then run in again with the evening tide, and make
      Skinburness; or, if there&rsquo;s not light, we can run into the Wampool river,
      and put you ashore about Kirkbride or Leaths, with the long-boat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fairford, unwell before, felt this destination condemned him to an agony
      of many hours, which his disordered stomach and aching head were ill able
      to endure. There was no remedy, however, but patience, and the
      recollection that he was suffering in the cause of friendship. As the sun
      rose high, he became worse; his sense of smell appeared to acquire a
      morbid degree of acuteness, for the mere purpose of inhaling and
      distinguishing all the various odours with which he was surrounded, from
      that of pitch to all the complicated smells of the hold. His heart, too,
      throbbed under the heat, and he felt as if in full progress towards a high
      fever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The seamen, who were civil and attentive considering their calling,
      observed his distress, and one contrived to make an awning out of an old
      sail, while another compounded some lemonade, the only liquor which their
      passenger could be prevailed upon to touch. After drinking it off, he
      obtained, but could not be said to enjoy, a few hours of troubled slumber.

      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      NARRATIVE OF ALAN FAIRFORD, CONTINUED
    </h3>
    <p>
      Alan Fairford&rsquo;s spirit was more ready to encounter labour than his frame
      was adequate to support it. In spite of his exertions, when he awoke,
      after five or six hours&rsquo; slumber, he found that he was so much disabled by
      dizziness in his head and pains in his limbs, that he could not raise
      himself without assistance. He heard with some pleasure that they were now
      running right for the Wampool river, and that he would be put on shore in
      a very short time. The vessel accordingly lay to, and presently showed a
      weft in her ensign, which was hastily answered by signals from on shore.
      Men and horses were seen to come down the broken path which leads to the
      shore; the latter all properly tackled for carrying their loading. Twenty
      fishing barks were pushed afloat at once, and crowded round the brig with
      much clamour, laughter, cursing, and jesting. Amidst all this apparent
      confusion there was the essential regularity. Nanty Ewart again walked his
      quarter-deck as if he had never tasted spirits in his life, issued the
      necessary orders with precision, and saw them executed with punctuality.
      In half an hour the loading of the brig was in a great measure disposed in
      the boats; in a quarter of an hour more, it was landed on the beach, and
      another interval of about the same duration was sufficient to distribute
      it on the various strings of packhorses which waited for that purpose, and
      which instantly dispersed, each on its own proper adventure. More mystery
      was observed in loading the ship&rsquo;s boat with a quantity of small barrels,
      which seemed to contain ammunition. This was not done until the commercial
      customers had been dismissed; and it was not until this was performed that
      Ewart proposed to Alan, as he lay stunned with pain and noise, to
      accompany him ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with difficulty that Fairford could get over the side of the
      vessel, and he could not seat himself on the stern of the boat without
      assistance from the captain and his people. Nanty Ewart, who saw nothing
      in this worse than an ordinary fit of sea-sickness, applied the usual
      topics of consolation. He assured his passenger that he would be quite
      well by and by, when he had been half an hour on terra firma, and that he
      hoped to drink a can and smoke a pipe with him at Father Crackenthorp&rsquo;s,
      for all that he felt a little out of the way for riding the wooden horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is Father Crackenthorp?&rsquo; said Fairford, though scarcely able to
      articulate the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As honest a fellow as is of a thousand,&rsquo; answered Nanty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, how much good brandy he and I have made little of in our day! By my
      soul, Mr. Fairbird, he is the prince of skinkers, and the father of the
      free trade&mdash;not a stingy hypocritical devil like old Turnpenny
      Skinflint, that drinks drunk on other folk&rsquo;s cost, and thinks it sin when
      he has to pay for it&mdash;but a real hearty old cock;&mdash;the sharks
      have been at and about him this many a day, but Father Crackenthorp knows
      how to trim his sails&mdash;never a warrant but he hears of it before the
      ink&rsquo;s dry. He is BONUS SOCIUS with headborough and constable. The king&rsquo;s
      exchequer could not bribe a man to inform against him. If any such rascal
      were to cast up, why, he would miss his ears next morning, or be sent to
      seek them in the Solway. He is a statesman, [A small landed proprietor.]
      though he keeps a public; but, indeed, that is only for convenience and to
      excuse his having cellarage and folk about him; his wife&rsquo;s a canny woman&mdash;and
      his daughter Doll too. Gad, you&rsquo;ll be in port there till you get round
      again; and I&rsquo;ll keep my word with you, and bring you to speech of the
      laird.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gad, the only trouble I shall have is to get you out of the house; for
      Doll is a rare wench, and my dame a funny old one, and Father Crackenthorp
      the rarest companion! He&rsquo;ll drink you a bottle of rum or brandy without
      starting, but never wet his lips with the nasty Scottish stuff that the
      canting old scoundrel Turnpenny has brought into fashion. He is a
      gentleman, every inch of him, old Crackenthorp; in his own way, that is;
      and besides, he has a share in the JUMPING JENNY, and many a moonlight
      outfit besides. He can give Doll a pretty penny, if he likes the tight
      fellow that would turn in with her for life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of this prolonged panegyric on Father Crackenthorp, the boat
      touched the beach, the rowers backed their oars to keep her afloat, whilst
      the other fellows lumped into the surf, and, with the most rapid
      dexterity, began to hand the barrels ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Up with them higher on the beach, my hearties,&rsquo; exclaimed Nanty Ewart&mdash;&lsquo;High
      and dry&mdash;high and dry&mdash;this gear will not stand wetting. Now,
      out with our spare hand here&mdash;high and dry with him too. What&rsquo;s that?&mdash;the
      galloping of horse! Oh, I hear the jingle of the packsaddles&mdash;they
      are our own folk.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time all the boat&rsquo;s load was ashore, consisting of the little
      barrels; and the boat&rsquo;s crew, standing to their arms, ranged themselves in
      front, waiting the advance of the horses which came clattering along the
      beach. A man, overgrown with corpulence, who might be distinguished in the
      moonlight panting with his own exertions, appeared at the head of the
      cavalcade, which consisted of horses linked together, and accommodated
      with packsaddles, and chains for securing the kegs which made a dreadful
      clattering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How now, Father Crackenthorp?&rsquo; said Ewart&mdash;&lsquo;Why this hurry with your
      horses? We mean to stay a night with you, and taste your old brandy, and
      my dame&rsquo;s homebrewed. The signal is up, man, and all is right.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All is wrong, Captain Nanty,&rsquo; cried the man to whom he spoke; &lsquo;and you
      are the lad that is like to find it so, unless you bundle off&mdash;there
      are new brooms bought at Carlisle yesterday to sweep the country of you
      and the like of you&mdash;so you were better be jogging inland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How many rogues are the officers? If not more than ten, I will make
      fight.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The devil you will!&rsquo; answered Crackenthorp. &lsquo;You were better not, for
      they have the bloody-backed dragoons from Carlisle with them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, then,&rsquo; said Nanty, &lsquo;we must make sail. Come, Master Fairlord, you
      must mount and ride. He does not hear me&mdash;he has fainted, I believe&mdash;What
      the devil shall I do? Father Crackenthorp, I must leave this young fellow
      with you till the gale blows out&mdash;hark ye&mdash;goes between the
      laird and the t&rsquo;other old one; he can neither ride nor walk&mdash;I must
      send him up to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Send him up to the gallows!&rsquo; said Crackenthorp; &lsquo;there is Quartermaster
      Thwacker, with twenty men, up yonder; an he had not some kindness for
      Doll, I had never got hither for a start&mdash;but you must get off, or
      they will be here to seek us, for his orders are woundy particular; and
      these kegs contain worse than whisky&mdash;a hanging matter, I take it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish they were at the bottom of Wampool river, with them they belong
      to,&rsquo; said Nanty Ewart. &lsquo;But they are part of cargo; and what to do with
      the poor young fellow&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, many a better fellow has roughed it on the grass with a cloak o&rsquo;er
      him,&rsquo; said Crackenthorp. &lsquo;If he hath a fever, nothing is so cooling as the
      night air.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, he would be cold enough in the morning, no doubt; but it&rsquo;s a kind
      heart and shall not cool so soon if I can help it,&rsquo; answered the captain
      of the JUMPING JENNY.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, captain, an ye will risk your own neck for another man&rsquo;s, why not
      take him to the old girls at Fairladies?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, the Miss Arthurets! The Papist jades! But never mind; it will do&mdash;I
      have known them take in a whole sloop&rsquo;s crew that were stranded on the
      sands.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may run some risk, though, by turning up to Fairladies; for I tell
      you they are all up through the country.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind&mdash;I may chance to put some of them down again,&rsquo; said
      Nanty, cheerfully. &lsquo;Come, lads, bustle to your tackle. Are you all
      loaded?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, aye, captain; we will be ready in a jiffy,&rsquo; answered the gang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;D&mdash;n your captains! Have you a mind to have me hanged if I am taken?
      All&rsquo;s hail-fellow, here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A sup at parting,&rsquo; said Father Crackenthorp, extending a flask to Nanty
      Ewart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not the twentieth part of a drop,&rsquo; said Nanty. &lsquo;No Dutch courage for me&mdash;my
      heart is always high enough when there&rsquo;s a chance of fighting; besides, if
      I live drunk, I should like to die sober. Here, old Jephson&mdash;you are
      the best-natured brute amongst them&mdash;get the lad between us on a
      quiet horse, and we will keep him upright, I warrant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As they raised Fairford from the ground, he groaned heavily, and asked
      faintly where they were taking him to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To a place where you will be as snug and quiet as a mouse in his hole,&rsquo; 
      said Nanty, &lsquo;if so be that we can get you there safely. Good-bye, Father
      Crackenthorp&mdash;poison the quartermaster, if you can.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The loaded horses then sprang forward at a hard trot, following each other
      in a line, and every second horse being mounted by a stout fellow in a
      smock frock, which served to conceal the arms with which most of these
      desperate men were provided. Ewart followed in the rear of the line, and,
      with the occasional assistance of old Jephson, kept his young charge erect
      in the saddle. He groaned heavily from time to time; and Ewart, more moved
      with compassion for his situation than might have been expected from his
      own habits, endeavoured to amuse him and comfort him, by some account of
      the place to which they were conveying him&mdash;his words of consolation
      being, however, frequently interrupted by the necessity of calling to his
      people, and many of them being lost amongst the rattling of the barrels,
      and clinking of the tackle and small chains by which they are secured on
      such occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you see, brother, you will be in safe quarters at Fairladies&mdash;good
      old scrambling house&mdash;good old maids enough, if they were not
      Papists,&mdash;Hollo, you Jack Lowther; keep the line, can&rsquo;t ye, and shut
      your rattle-trap, you broth of a&mdash;? And so, being of a good family,
      and having enough, the old lasses have turned a kind of saints, and nuns,
      and so forth. The place they live in was some sort of nun-shop long ago,
      as they have them still in Flanders; so folk call them the Vestals of
      Fairladies&mdash;that may be, or may not be; and I care not whether it be
      or no.&mdash;Blinkinsop, hold your tongue, and be d&mdash;d!&mdash;And so,
      betwixt great alms and good dinners, they are well thought of by rich and
      poor, and their trucking with Papists is looked over. There are plenty of
      priests, and stout young scholars, and such-like, about the house it&rsquo;s a
      hive of them. More shame that government send dragoons out after-a few
      honest fellows that bring the old women of England a drop of brandy, and
      let these ragamuffins smuggle in as much papistry and&mdash;Hark!&mdash;was
      that a whistle? No, it&rsquo;s only a plover. You, Jem Collier, keep a look-out
      ahead&mdash;we&rsquo;ll meet them at the High Whins, or Brotthole bottom, or
      nowhere. Go a furlong ahead, I say, and look sharp.&mdash;These Misses
      Arthurets feed the hungry, and clothe the naked, and such-like acts&mdash;which
      my poor father used to say were filthy rags, but he dressed himself out
      with as many of them as most folk.&mdash;D&mdash;n that stumbling horse!
      Father Crackenthorp should be d&mdash;d himself for putting an honest
      fellow&rsquo;s neck in such jeopardy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, and with much more to the same purpose, Nanty ran on, increasing, by
      his well-intended annoyance, the agony of Alan Fairford, who, tormented by
      a racking pain along the back and loins, which made the rough trot of the
      horse torture to him, had his aching head still further rended and split
      by the hoarse voice of the sailor, close to his ear. Perfectly passive,
      however, he did not even essay to give any answer; and indeed his own
      bodily distress was now so great and engrossing, that to think of his
      situation was impossible, even if he could have mended it by doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their course was inland; but in what direction, Alan had no means of
      ascertaining. They passed at first over heaths and sandy downs; they
      crossed more than one brook, or beck, as they are called in that country&mdash;some
      of them of considerable depth&mdash;and at length reached a cultivated
      country, divided, according to the English fashion of agriculture, into
      very small fields or closes, by high banks, overgrown with underwood, and
      surmounted by hedge-row trees, amongst which winded a number of
      impracticable and complicated lanes, where the boughs projecting from the
      embankments on each side, intercepted the light of the moon, and
      endangered the safety of the horsemen. But through this labyrinth the
      experience of the guides conducted them without a blunder, and without
      even the slackening of their pace. In many places, however, it was
      impossible for three men to ride abreast; and therefore the burden of
      supporting Alan Fairford fell alternately to old Jephson and to Nanty; and
      it was with much difficulty that they could keep him upright in his
      saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, when his powers of sufferance were quite worn out, and he was
      about to implore them to leave him to his fate in the first cottage or
      shed&mdash;or under a haystack or a hedge&mdash;or anywhere, so he was
      left at ease, Collier, who rode ahead, passed back the word that they were
      at the avenue to Fairladies&mdash;&lsquo;Was he to turn up?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Committing the charge of Fairford to Jephson, Nanty dashed up to the head
      of the troop, and gave his orders.&mdash;&lsquo;Who knows the house best?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sam Skelton&rsquo;s a Catholic,&rsquo; said Lowther.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A d&mdash;d bad religion,&rsquo; said Nanty, of whose Presbyterian education a
      hatred of Popery seemed to be the only remnant. &lsquo;But I am glad there is
      one amongst us, anyhow. You, Sam, being a Papist, know Fairladies and the
      old maidens I dare say; so do you fall out of the line, and wait here with
      me; and do you, Collier, carry on to Walinford bottom, then turn down the
      beck till you come to the old mill, and Goodman Grist the Miller, or old
      Peel-the-Causeway, will tell you where to stow; but I will be up with you
      before that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The string of loaded horses then struck forward at their former pace,
      while Nanty, with Sam Skelton, waited by the roadside till the rear came
      up, when Jephson and Fairford joined them, and, to the great relief of the
      latter, they began to proceed at an easier pace than formerly, suffering
      the gang to precede them, till the clatter and clang attending their
      progress began to die away in the distance. They had not proceeded a
      pistol-shot from the place where they parted, when a short turning brought
      them in front of an old mouldering gateway, whose heavy pinnacles were
      decorated in the style of the seventeenth century, with clumsy
      architectural ornaments; several of which had fallen down from decay, and
      lay scattered about, no further care having been taken than just to remove
      them out of the direct approach to the avenue. The great stone pillars,
      glimmering white in the moonlight, had some fanciful resemblance to
      supernatural apparitions, and the air of neglect all around, gave an
      uncomfortable idea of the habitation to those who passed its avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There used to be no gate here,&rsquo; said Skelton, finding their way
      unexpectedly stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But there is a gate now, and a porter too,&rsquo; said a rough voice from
      within. &lsquo;Who be you, and what do you want at this time of night?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We want to come to speech of the ladies&mdash;of the Misses Arthuret,&rsquo; 
      said Nanty; &lsquo;and to ask lodging for a sick man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is no speech to be had of the Miss Arthurets at this time of night,
      and you may carry your sick man to the doctor,&rsquo; answered the fellow from
      within, gruffly; &lsquo;for as sure as there is savour in salt, and scent in
      rosemary, you will get no entrance&mdash;put your pipes up and be jogging
      on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, Dick Gardener,&rsquo; said Skelton, &lsquo;be thou then turned porter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, do you know who I am?&rsquo; said the domestic sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know you, by your by-word,&rsquo; answered the other; &lsquo;What, have you forgot
      little Sam Skelton, and the brock in the barrel?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I have not forgotten you,&rsquo; answered the acquaintance of Sam Skelton;
      &lsquo;but my orders are peremptory to let no one up the avenue this night, and
      therefore&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But we are armed, and will not be kept back,&rsquo; said Nanty. &lsquo;Hark ye,
      fellow, were it not better for you to take a guinea and let us in, than to
      have us break the door first, and thy pate afterwards? for I won&rsquo;t see my
      comrade die at your door be assured of that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, I dunna know,&rsquo; said the fellow; &lsquo;but what cattle were those that
      rode by in such hurry?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, some of our folk from Bowness, Stoniecultrum, and thereby,&rsquo; answered
      Skelton; &lsquo;Jack Lowther, and old Jephson, and broad Will Lamplugh, and such
      like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Dick Gardener, &lsquo;as sure as there is savour in salt, and scent
      in rosemary, I thought it had been the troopers from Carlisle and Wigton,
      and the sound brought my heart to my mouth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Had thought thou wouldst have known the clatter of a cask from the clash
      of a broadsword, as well as e&rsquo;er a quaffer in Cumberland,&rsquo; said Skelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, brother, less of your jaw and more of your legs, if you please,&rsquo; 
      said Nanty; &lsquo;every moment we stay is a moment lost. Go to the ladies, and
      tell them that Nanty Ewart, of the JUMPING JENNY, has brought a young
      gentleman, charged with letters from Scotland to a certain gentleman of
      consequence in Cumberland&mdash;that the soldiers are out, and the
      gentleman is very ill and if he is not received at Fairladies he must be
      left either to die at the gate, or to be taken, with all his papers about
      him, by the redcoats.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Away ran Dick Gardener with this message; and, in a few minutes, lights
      were seen to flit about, which convinced Fairford, who was now, in
      consequence of the halt, a little restored to self-possession, that they
      were traversing the front of a tolerably large mansion-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What if thy friend, Dick Gardener, comes not back again?&rsquo; said Jephson to
      Skelton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, then,&rsquo; said the person addressed, &lsquo;I shall owe him just such a
      licking as thou, old Jephson, had from Dan Cooke, and will pay as duly and
      truly as he did.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man was about to make an angry reply, when his doubts were
      silenced by the return of Dick Gardener, who announced that Miss Arthuret
      was coming herself as far as the gateway to speak with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nanty Ewart cursed in a low tone the suspicions of old maids and the
      churlish scruples of Catholics, that made so many obstacles to helping a
      fellow creature, and wished Miss Arthuret a hearty rheumatism or toothache
      as the reward of her excursion; but the lady presently appeared, to cut
      short further grumbling. She was attended by a waiting-maid with a
      lantern, by means of which she examined the party on the outside, as
      closely as the imperfect light, and the spars of the newly-erected gate,
      would permit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sorry we have disturbed you so late, Madam Arthuret,&rsquo; said Nanty;
      &lsquo;but the case is this&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Holy Virgin,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;why do you speak so loud? Pray, are you not the
      captain of the SAINTE GENEVIEVE?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, aye, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; answered Ewart, &lsquo;they call the brig so at Dunkirk, sure
      enough; but along shore here, they call her the JUMPING JENNY.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You brought over the holy Father Buonaventure, did you not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, aye, madam, I have brought over enough of them black cattle,&rsquo; 
      answered Nanty. &lsquo;Fie! fie! friend,&rsquo; said Miss Arthuret; &lsquo;it is a pity that
      the saints should commit these good men to a heretic&rsquo;s care.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, no more they would, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; answered Nanty, &lsquo;could they find a
      Papist lubber that knew the coast as I do; then I am trusty as steel to
      owners, and always look after cargo&mdash;live lumber, or dead flesh, or
      spirits, all is one to me; and your Catholics have such d&mdash;d large
      hoods, with pardon, ma&rsquo;am, that they can sometimes hide two faces under
      them. But here is a gentleman dying, with letters about him from the Laird
      of Summertrees to the Laird of the Lochs, as they call him, along Solway,
      and every minute he lies here is a nail in his coffin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Saint Mary! what shall we do?&rsquo; said Miss Arthuret; &lsquo;we must admit him, I
      think, at all risks. You, Richard Gardener, help one of these men to carry
      the gentleman up to the Place; and you, Selby, see him lodged at the end
      of the long gallery. You are a heretic, captain, but I think you are
      trusty, and I know you have been trusted&mdash;but if you are imposing on
      me&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not I, madam&mdash;never attempt to impose on ladies of your experience&mdash;my
      practice that way has been all among the young ones. Come, cheerly, Mr.
      Fairford&mdash;you will be taken good care of&mdash;try to walk.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan did so; and, refreshed by his halt, declared himself able to walk to
      the house with the sole assistance of the gardener.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, that&rsquo;s hearty. Thank thee, Dick, for lending him thine arm&rsquo;&mdash;and
      Nanty slipped into his hand the guinea he had promised.&mdash;&lsquo;Farewell,
      then, Mr. Fairford, and farewell, Madam Arthuret, for I have been too long
      here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he and his two companions threw themselves on horseback, and
      went off at a gallop. Yet, even above the clatter of their hoofs did the
      incorrigible Nanty hollo out the old ballad&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  A lovely lass to a friar came,
  To confession a-morning early;&mdash;
  &lsquo;In what, my dear, are you to blame?
  Come tell me most sincerely?&rsquo; 
  &lsquo;Alas!  my fault I dare not name&mdash;
  But my lad he loved me dearly.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Holy Virgin!&rsquo; exclaimed Miss Seraphina, as the unhallowed sounds reached
      her ears; &lsquo;what profane heathens be these men, and what frights and
      pinches we be put to among them! The saints be good to us, what a night
      has this been!&mdash;the like never seen at Fairladies. Help me to make
      fast the gate, Richard, and thou shalt come down again to wait on it, lest
      there come more unwelcome visitors&mdash;Not that you are unwelcome, young
      gentleman, for it is sufficient that you need such assistance as we can
      give you, to make you welcome to Fairladies&mdash;only, another time would
      have done as well&mdash;but, hem! I dare say it is all for the best. The
      avenue is none of the smoothest, sir, look to your feet. Richard Gardener
      should have had it mown and levelled, but he was obliged to go on a
      pilgrimage to Saint Winifred&rsquo;s Well, in Wales.&rsquo; (Here Dick gave a short
      dry cough, which, as if he had found it betrayed some internal feeling a
      little at variance with what the lady said, he converted into a muttered
      SANCTA WINIFREDA, ORA PRO NOBIS. Miss Arthuret, meantime, proceeded) &lsquo;We
      never interfere with our servants&rsquo; vows or penances, Master Fairford&mdash;I
      know a very worthy father of your name, perhaps a relation&mdash;I say, we
      never interfere with our servants vows. Our Lady forbid they should not
      know some difference between our service and a heretic&rsquo;s.&mdash;Take care,
      sir, you will fall if you have not a care. Alas! by night and day there
      are many stumbling-blocks in our paths!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With more talk to the same purpose, all of which tended to show a
      charitable and somewhat silly woman with a strong inclination to her
      superstitious devotion, Miss Arthuret entertained her new guest, as,
      stumbling at every obstacle which the devotion of his guide, Richard, had
      left in the path, he at last, by ascending some stone steps decorated on
      the side with griffins, or some such heraldic anomalies, attained a
      terrace extending in front of the Place of Fairladies; an old-fashioned
      gentleman&rsquo;s house of some consequence, with its range of notched
      gable-ends and narrow windows, relieved by here and there an old turret
      about the size of a pepper-box. The door was locked during the brief
      absence of the mistress; a dim light glimmered through the sashed door of
      the hall, which opened beneath a huge stone porch, loaded with jessamine
      and other creepers. All the windows were dark as pitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Arthuret tapped at the door. &lsquo;Sister, sister Angelica.&rsquo; &lsquo;Who is
      there?&rsquo; was answered from within; &lsquo;is it you, sister Seraphina?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes, undo the door; do you not know my voice?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No doubt, sister,&rsquo; said Angelica, undoing bolt and bar; &lsquo;but you know our
      charge, and the enemy is watchful to surprise us&mdash;INCEDIT SICUT LEO
      VORANS, saith the breviary. Whom have you brought here? Oh, sister, what
      have you done?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is a young man,&rsquo; said Seraphina, hastening to interrupt her sister&rsquo;s
      remonstrance, &lsquo;a relation, I believe, of our worthy Father Fairford; left
      at the gate by the captain of that blessed vessel the SAINTE GENEVIEVE&mdash;almost
      dead&mdash;and charged with dispatches to &lsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      She lowered her voice as she mumbled over the last words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, then, there is no help,&rsquo; said Angelica; &lsquo;but it is unlucky.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      During this dialogue between the vestals of Fairladies, Dick Gardener
      deposited his burden in a chair, where the young lady, after a moment of
      hesitation, expressing a becoming reluctance to touch the hand of a
      stranger, put her finger and thumb upon Fairford&rsquo;s wrist, and counted his
      pulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is fever here, sister,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;Richard must call Ambrose, and
      we must send some of the febrifuge.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ambrose arrived presently, a plausible and respectable-looking old
      servant, bred in the family, and who had risen from rank to rank in the
      Arthuret service till he was become half-physician, half-almoner,
      half-butler, and entire governor; that is, when the Father Confessor, who
      frequently eased him of the toils of government, chanced to be abroad.
      Under the direction, and with the assistance of this venerable personage,
      the unlucky Alan Fairford was conveyed to a decent apartment at the end of
      a long gallery, and, to his inexpressible relief, consigned to a
      comfortable bed. He did not attempt to resist the prescription of Mr.
      Ambrose, who not only presented him with the proposed draught, but
      proceeded so far as to take a considerable quantity of blood from him, by
      which last operation he probably did his patient much service.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      NARRATIVE OF ALAN FAIRFORD, CONTINUED
    </h3>
    <p>
      On the next morning, when Fairford awoke, after no very refreshing
      slumbers, in which were mingled many wild dreams of his father and of
      Darsie Latimer,&mdash;of the damsel in the green mantle and the vestals of
      Fairladies,&mdash;of drinking small beer with Nanty Ewart and being
      immersed in the Solway with the JUMPING JENNY,&mdash;he found himself in
      no condition to dispute the order of Mr. Ambrose, that he should keep his
      bed, from which, indeed, he could not have raised himself without
      assistance. He became sensible that his anxiety, and his constant efforts
      for some days past, had been too much for his health, and that, whatever
      might be his impatience, he could not proceed in his undertaking until his
      strength was re-established.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile, no better quarters could have been found for an invalid.
      The attendants spoke under their breath, and moved only on tiptoe&mdash;nothing
      was done unless PAR ORDONNANCE DU MEDECIN. Aesculapius reigned paramount
      in the premises at Fairladies. Once a day, the ladies came in great state
      to wait upon him and inquire after his health, and it was then that;
      Alan&rsquo;s natural civility, and the thankfulness which he expressed for their
      timely and charitable assistance, raised him considerably in their esteem.
      He was on the third day removed to a better apartment than that in which
      he had been at first accommodated. When he was permitted to drink a glass
      of wine, it was of the first quality; one of those curious old-fashioned
      cobwebbed bottles being produced on the occasion, which are only to be
      found in the crypts of old country-seats, where they may have lurked
      undisturbed for more than half a century.
    </p>
    <p>
      But however delightful a residence for an invalid, Fairladies, as its
      present inmate became soon aware, was not so agreeable to a convalescent.
      When he dragged himself to the window so soon as he could crawl from bed,
      behold it was closely grated, and commanded no view except of a little
      paved court. This was nothing remarkable, most old Border houses having
      their windows so secured. But then Fairford observed, that whosoever
      entered or left the room always locked the door with great care and
      circumspection; and some proposals which he made to take a walk in the
      gallery, or even in the garden, were so coldly received, both by the
      ladies and their prime minister, Mr. Ambrose, that he saw plainly such an
      extension of his privileges as a guest would not be permitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anxious to ascertain whether this excessive hospitality would permit him
      his proper privilege of free agency, he announced to this important
      functionary, with grateful thanks for the care with which he had been
      attended, his purpose to leave Fairladies next morning, requesting only,
      as a continuance of the favours with which he had been loaded, the loan of
      a horse to the next town; and, assuring Mr. Ambrose that his gratitude
      would not be limited by such, a trifle, he slipped three guineas into his
      hand, by way of seconding his proposal. The fingers of that worthy
      domestic closed as naturally upon the honorarium, as if a degree in the
      learned faculty had given him a right to clutch it; but his answer
      concerning Alan&rsquo;s proposed departure was at first evasive, and when he was
      pushed, it amounted to a peremptory assurance that he could not be
      permitted to depart to-morrow; it was as much as his life was worth, and
      his ladies would not authorize it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know best what my own life is worth,&rsquo; said Alan; &lsquo;and I do not value it
      in comparison to the business which requires my instant attention.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Receiving still no satisfactory answer from Mr. Ambrose, Fairford thought
      it best to state his resolution to the ladies themselves, in the most
      measured, respectful, and grateful terms; but still such as expressed a
      firm determination to depart on the morrow, or next day at farthest. After
      some attempts to induce him to stay, on the alleged score of health, which
      were so expressed that he was convinced they were only used to delay his
      departure, Fairford plainly told them that he was entrusted with
      dispatches of consequence to the gentleman known by the name of Herries,
      Redgauntlet, and the Laird of the Lochs; and that it was matter of life
      and death to deliver them early.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dare say, Sister Angelica,&rsquo; said the elder Miss Arthuret, that the
      gentleman is honest; and if he is really a relation of Father Fairford, we
      can run no risk.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jesu Maria!&rsquo; exclaimed the younger. &lsquo;Oh, fie, Sister Seraphina! Fie, fie!&mdash;&lsquo;VADE
      RETRO&mdash;get thee behind me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well; but, sister&mdash;Sister Angelica&mdash;let me speak with you
      in the gallery.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So out the ladies rustled in their silks and tissues, and it was a good
      half-hour ere they rustled in again, with importance and awe on their
      countenances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To tell you the truth, Mr. Fairford, the cause of our desire to delay you
      is&mdash;there is a religious gentleman in this house at present&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A most excellent person indeed&rsquo;&mdash;said the sister Angelica.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An anointed of his Master!&rsquo; echoed Seraphina,&mdash;&lsquo;and we should be
      glad that, for conscience&rsquo; sake, you would hold some discourse with him
      before your departure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oho!&rsquo; thought Fairford, &lsquo;the murder is out&mdash;here is a design of
      conversion! I must not affront the good ladies, but I shall soon send off
      the priest, I think.&rsquo; He then answered aloud, &lsquo;that he should be happy to
      converse with any friend of theirs&mdash;that in religious matters he had
      the greatest respect for every modification of Christianity, though, he
      must say, his belief was made up to that in which he had been educated;
      nevertheless, if his seeing the religious person they recommended could in
      the least show his respect&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not quite that,&rsquo; said Sister Seraphina, &lsquo;although I am sure the day
      is too short to hear him&mdash;Father Buonaventure, I mean&mdash;speak
      upon the concerns of our souls; but&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, come, Sister Seraphina,&rsquo; said the younger, &lsquo;it is needless to talk
      so much about it. His&mdash;his Eminence&mdash;I mean Father Buonaventure&mdash;will
      himself explain what he wants this gentleman to know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His Eminence!&rsquo; said Fairford, surprised&mdash;&lsquo;is this gentleman so high
      in the Catholic Church? The title is given only to Cardinals, I think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is not a Cardinal as yet,&rsquo; answered Seraphina; &lsquo;but I assure you, Mr.
      Fairford, he is as high in rank as he is eminently endowed with good
      gifts, and&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come away,&rsquo; said Sister Angelica. &lsquo;Holy Virgin, how you do talk! What has
      Mr. Fairford to do with Father Buonaventure&rsquo;s rank? Only, sir, you will
      remember that the Father has been always accustomed to be treated with the
      most profound deference; indeed&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come away, sister,&rsquo; said Sister Seraphina, in her turn; &lsquo;who talks now, I
      pray you? Mr. Fairford will know how to comport himself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And we had best both leave the room,&rsquo; said the younger lady, &lsquo;for here
      his Eminence comes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She lowered her voice to a whisper as she pronounced the last words; and
      as Fairford was about to reply, by assuring her that any friend of hers
      should be treated by him with all the ceremony he could expect, she
      imposed silence on him, by holding up her finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      A solemn and stately step was now heard in the gallery; it might have
      proclaimed the approach not merely of a bishop or cardinal, but of the
      Sovereign Pontiff himself. Nor could the sound have been more respectfully
      listened to by the two ladies, had it announced that the Head of the
      Church was approaching in person. They drew themselves, like sentinels on
      duty, one on each side of the door by which the long gallery communicated
      with Fairford&rsquo;s apartment, and stood there immovable, and with
      countenances expressive of the deepest reverence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The approach of Father Buonaventure was so slow, that Fairford had time to
      notice all this, and to marvel in his mind what wily and ambitious priest
      could have contrived to subject his worthy but simple-minded hostesses to
      such superstitious trammels. Father Buonaventure&rsquo;s entrance and appearance
      in some degree accounted for the whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a man of middle life, about forty or upwards; but either care, or
      fatigue, or indulgence, had brought on the appearance of premature old
      age, and given to his fine features a cast of seriousness or even sadness.
      A noble countenance, however, still remained; and though his complexion
      was altered, and wrinkles stamped upon his brow in many a melancholy fold,
      still the lofty forehead, the full and well-opened eye, and the
      well-formed nose, showed how handsome in better days he must have been. He
      was tall, but lost the advantage of his height by stooping; and the cane
      which he wore always in his hand, and occasionally used, as well as his
      slow though majestic gait, seemed to intimate that his form and limbs felt
      already some touch of infirmity. The colour of his hair could not be
      discovered, as, according to the fashion, he wore a periwig. He was
      handsomely, though gravely dressed in a secular habit, and had a cockade
      in his hat; circumstances which did not surprise Fairford, who knew that a
      military disguise was very often assumed by the seminary priests, whose
      visits to England, or residence there, subjected them to legal penalties.
    </p>
    <p>
      As this stately person entered the apartment, the two ladies facing
      inward, like soldiers on their post when about to salute a superior
      officer, dropped on either hand of the father a curtsy so profound that
      the hoop petticoats which performed the feat seemed to sink down to the
      very floor, nay, through it, as if a trap-door had opened for the descent
      of the dames who performed this act of reverence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father seemed accustomed to such homage, profound as it was; he turned
      his person a little way first towards one sister, and then towards the
      other, while, with a gracious inclination of his person, which certainly
      did not amount to a bow, he acknowledged their curtsy. But he passed
      forward without addressing them, and seemed by doing so to intimate that
      their presence in the apartment was unnecessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      They accordingly glided out of the room, retreating backwards, with hands
      clasped and eyes cast upwards, as if imploring blessings on the religious
      man whom they venerated so highly. The door of the apartment was shut
      after them, but not before Fairford had perceived that there were one or
      two men in the gallery, and that, contrary to what he had before observed,
      the door, though shut, was not locked on the outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can the good souls apprehend danger from me to this god of their
      idolatry?&rsquo; thought Fairford. But he had no time to make further
      observations, for the stranger had already reached the middle of his
      apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fairford rose to receive him respectfully, but as he fixed his eyes on the
      visitor, he thought that the father avoided his looks. His reasons for
      remaining incognito were cogent enough to account for this, and Fairford
      hastened to relieve him, by looking downwards in his turn; but when again
      he raised his face, he found the broad light eye of the stranger so fixed
      on him that he was almost put out of countenance by the steadiness of his
      gaze. During this time they remained standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take your seat, sir,&rsquo; said the father; &lsquo;you have been an invalid.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with the tone of one who desires an inferior to be seated in his
      presence, and his voice was full and melodious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fairford, somewhat surprised to find himself overawed by the airs of
      superiority, which could be only properly exercised towards one over whom
      religion gave the speaker influence, sat down at his bidding, as if moved
      by springs, and was at a loss how to assert the footing of equality on
      which he felt that they ought to stand. The stranger kept the advantage
      which he had obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your name, sir, I am informed, is Fairford?&rsquo; said the father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan answered by a bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Called to the Scottish bar,&rsquo; continued his visitor, &lsquo;There is, I believe,
      in the West, a family of birth and rank called Fairford of Fairford.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan thought this a strange observation from a foreign ecclesiastic, as
      his name intimated Father Buonaventure to be; but only answered he
      believed there was such, a family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you count kindred with them, Mr. Fairford?&rsquo; continued the inquirer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have not the honour to lay such a claim,&rsquo; said Fairford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My father&rsquo;s industry has raised his family from a low and obscure
      situation&mdash;I have no hereditary claim to distinction of any kind. May
      I ask the cause of these inquiries?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will learn it presently,&rsquo; said Father Buonaventure, who had given a
      dry and dissatisfied HEM at the young man&rsquo;s acknowledging a plebeian
      descent. He then motioned to him to be silent, and proceeded with his
      queries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Although not of condition, you are, doubtless, by sentiments and
      education, a man of honour and a gentleman?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope so, sir,&rsquo; said Alan, colouring with displeasure. &lsquo;I have not been
      accustomed to have it questioned.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Patience, young man,&rsquo; said the unperturbed querist&mdash;&lsquo;we are on
      serious business, and no idle etiquette must prevent its being discussed
      seriously. You are probably aware that you speak to a person proscribed by
      the severe and unjust laws of the present government?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am aware of the statute 1700, chapter 3,&rsquo; said Alan, &lsquo;banishing from
      the realm priests and trafficking Papists, and punishing by death, on
      summary conviction, any such person who being so banished may return. But
      I have no means of knowing you, sir, to be one of those persons; and I
      think your prudence may recommend to you to keep your own counsel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is sufficient, sir; and I have no apprehensions of disagreeable
      consequences from your having seen me in this house,&rsquo; said the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Assuredly no,&rsquo; said Alan. &lsquo;I consider myself as indebted for my life to
      the mistresses of Fairladies; and it would be a vile requital on my part
      to pry into or make known what I may have seen or heard under this
      hospitable roof. If I were to meet the Pretender himself in such a
      situation, he should, even at the risk of a little stretch to my loyalty,
      be free from any danger from my indiscretion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Pretender!&rsquo; said the priest, with some angry emphasis; but
      immediately softened his tone and added, &lsquo;No doubt, however, that person
      is a pretender; and some people think his pretensions are not ill founded.
      But, before running into politics, give me leave to say, that I am
      surprised to find a gentleman of your opinions in habits of intimacy with
      Mr. Maxwell of Summertrees and Mr. Redgauntlet, and the medium of
      conducting the intercourse betwixt them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pardon me, sir,&rsquo; replied Alan Fairford; &lsquo;I do not aspire to the honour of
      being reputed their confidant or go-between. My concern with those
      gentlemen is limited to one matter of business, dearly interesting to me,
      because it concerns the safety&mdash;perhaps the life&mdash;of my dearest
      friend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would you have any objection to entrust me with the cause of your
      journey?&rsquo; said Father Buonaventure. &lsquo;My advice may be of service to you,
      and my influence with one or both these gentlemen is considerable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fairford hesitated a moment, and, hastily revolving all circumstances,
      concluded that he might perhaps receive some advantage from propitiating
      this personage; while, on the other hand, he endangered nothing by
      communicating to him the occasion of his journey. He, therefore, after
      stating shortly that he hoped Mr. Buonaventure would render him the same
      confidence which he required on his part, gave a short account of Darsie
      Latimer&mdash;of the mystery which hung over his family&mdash;and of the
      disaster which had befallen him. Finally, of his own resolution to seek
      for his friend, and to deliver him, at the peril of his own life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Catholic priest, whose manner it seemed to be to avoid all
      conversation which did not arise from his own express motion, made no
      remarks upon what he had heard, but only asked one or two abrupt
      questions, where Alan&rsquo;s narrative appeared less clear to him; then rising
      from his seat, he took two turns through the apartment, muttering between
      his teeth, with emphasis, the word &lsquo;madman!&rsquo; But apparently he was in the
      habit of keeping all violent emotions under restraint; for he presently
      addressed Fairford with the most perfect indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you thought you could do so without breach of confidence,
      I wish you would have the goodness to show me the letter of Mr. Maxwell of
      Summertrees. I desire to look particularly at the address.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing no cause to decline this extension of his confidence, Alan, without
      hesitation, put the letter into his hand. Having turned it round as old
      Trumbull and Nanty Ewart had formerly done, and, like them, having
      examined the address with much minuteness, he asked whether he had
      observed these words, pointing to a pencil-writing upon the under side of
      the letter. Fairford answered in the negative, and, looking at the letter,
      read with surprise, &lsquo;CAVE NE LITERAS BELLEROPHONTIS ADFERRES&rsquo;; a caution
      which coincided so exactly with the provost&rsquo;s admonition, that he would do
      well to inspect the letter of which he was bearer, that he was about to
      spring up and attempt an escape, he knew not wherefore, or from whom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sit still, young man,&rsquo; said the father, with the same tone of authority
      which reigned in his whole manner, although mingled with stately courtesy.
      &lsquo;You are in no danger&mdash;my character shall be a pledge for your
      safety. By whom do you suppose these words have been written?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fairford could have answered, &lsquo;By Nanty Ewart,&rsquo; for he remembered seeing
      that person scribble something with a pencil, although he was not well
      enough to observe with accuracy where or upon what. But not knowing what
      suspicions, or what worse consequences the seamen&rsquo;s interest in his
      affairs might draw upon him, he judged it best to answer that he knew not
      the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Buonaventure was again silent for a moment or two, which he
      employed in surveying the letter with the strictest attention; then
      stepped to the window, as if to examine the address and writing of the
      envelope with the assistance of a stronger light, and Alan Fairford beheld
      him, with no less amazement than high displeasure, coolly and deliberately
      break the seal, open the letter, and peruse the contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop, sir, hold!&rsquo; he exclaimed, so soon as his astonishment permitted him
      to express his resentment in words; &lsquo;by what right do you dare&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Peace, young gentleman,&rsquo; said the father, repelling him with a wave of
      his hand; &lsquo;be assured I do not act without warrant&mdash;nothing can pass
      betwixt Mr. Maxwell and Mr. Redgauntlet that I am not fully entitled to
      know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It may be so,&rsquo; said Alan, extremely angry; &lsquo;but though you may be these
      gentlemen&rsquo;s father confessor, you are not mine; and in breaking the seal
      of a letter entrusted to my care, you have done me&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No injury, I assure you,&rsquo; answered the unperturbed priest; &lsquo;on the
      contrary, it may be a service.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I desire no advantage at such a rate, or to be obtained in such a
      manner,&rsquo; answered Fairford; &lsquo;restore me the letter instantly, or&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As you regard your own safety,&rsquo; said the priest, &lsquo;forbear all injurious
      expressions, and all menacing gestures. I am not one who can be threatened
      or insulted with impunity; and there are enough within hearing to chastise
      any injury or affront offered to me, in case I may think it unbecoming to
      protect or avenge myself with my own hand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In saying this, the father assumed an air of such fearlessness and calm
      authority, that the young lawyer, surprised and overawed, forbore, as he
      had intended, to snatch the letter from his hand, and confined himself to
      bitter complaints of the impropriety of his conduct, and of the light in
      which he himself must be placed to Redgauntlet should he present him a
      letter with a broken seal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That,&rsquo; said Father Buonaventure, &lsquo;shall be fully cared for. I will myself
      write to Redgauntlet, and enclose Maxwell&rsquo;s letter, provided always you
      continue to desire to deliver it, after perusing the contents.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He then restored the letter to Fairford, and, observing that he hesitated
      to peruse it, said emphatically, &lsquo;Read it, for it concerns you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This recommendation, joined to what Provost Crosbie had formerly
      recommended, and to the warning which he doubted not that Nanty intended
      to convey by his classical allusion, decided Fairford&rsquo;s resolution. &lsquo;If
      these correspondents,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;are conspiring against my person, I
      have a right to counterplot them; self-preservation, as well as my
      friend&rsquo;s safety, require that I should not be too scrupulous.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So thinking, he read the letter, which was in the following words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;DEAR RUGGED AND DANGEROUS, &lsquo;Will you never cease meriting your old
      nick-name? You have springed your dottrel, I find, and what is the
      consequence?&mdash;why, that there will be hue and cry after you
      presently. The bearer is a pert young lawyer, who has brought a formal
      complaint against you, which, luckily, he has preferred in a friendly
      court. Yet, favourable as the judge was disposed to be, it was with the
      utmost difficulty that cousin Jenny and I could keep him to his tackle. He
      begins to be timid, suspicious, and untractable, and I fear Jenny will
      soon bend her brows on him in vain. I know not what to advise&mdash;the
      lad who carries this is a good lad&mdash;active for his friend&mdash;and I
      have pledged my honour he shall have no personal ill-usage. Pledged my
      honour, remark these words, and remember I can be rugged and dangerous as
      well, as my neighbours. But I have not ensured him against a short
      captivity, and as he is a stirring active fellow, I see no remedy but
      keeping him out of the way till this business of the good Father B&mdash;&mdash;
      is safely blown over, which God send it were!&mdash;Always thine, even
      should I be once more CRAIG-IN-PERIL.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What think you, young man, of the danger you have been about to encounter
      so willingly?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As strangely,&rsquo; replied Alan Fairford, &lsquo;as of the extraordinary means
      which you have been at present pleased to use for the discovery of Mr.
      Maxwell&rsquo;s purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Trouble not yourself to account for my conduct,&rsquo; said the father; &lsquo;I have
      a warrant for what I do, and fear no responsibility. But tell me what is
      your present purpose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should not perhaps name it to you, whose own safety may be implicated.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I understand you,&rsquo; answered the father; &lsquo;you would appeal to the existing
      government? That can at no rate be permitted&mdash;we will rather detain
      you at Fairladies by compulsion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will probably,&rsquo; said Fairford, &lsquo;first weigh the risk of such a
      proceeding in a free country.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have incurred more formidable hazard,&rsquo; said the priest, smiling; &lsquo;yet I
      am willing to find a milder expedient. Come; let us bring the matter to a
      compromise.&rsquo; And he assumed a conciliating graciousness of manner, which
      struck Fairford as being rather too condescending for the occasion; &lsquo;I
      presume you will be satisfied to remain here in seclusion for a day or two
      longer, provided I pass my solemn word to you that you shall meet with the
      person whom you seek after&mdash;meet with him in perfect safety, and, I
      trust, in good health, and be afterwards both at liberty to return to
      Scotland, or dispose of yourselves as each of you may be minded?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I respect the VERBUM SACERDOTIS as much as can reasonably be expected
      from a Protestant,&rsquo; answered Fairford; &lsquo;but methinks, you can scarce
      expect me to repose so much confidence in the word of an unknown person as
      is implied in the guarantee which you offer me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not accustomed, sir,&rsquo; said the father, in a very haughty tone, &lsquo;to
      have my word disputed. But,&rsquo; he added, while the angry hue passed from his
      cheek, after a moment&rsquo;s reflection, &lsquo;you know me not, and ought to be
      excused. I will repose more confidence in your honour than you seem
      willing to rest upon mine; and, since we are so situated that one must
      rely upon the other&rsquo;s faith, I will cause you to be set presently at
      liberty, and furnished with the means of delivering your letter as
      addressed, provided that now, knowing the contents, you think it safe for
      yourself to execute the commission.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan Fairford paused. &lsquo;I cannot see,&rsquo; he at length replied, &lsquo;how I can
      proceed with respect to the accomplishment of my sole purpose, which is
      the liberation of my friend, without appealing to the law and obtaining
      the assistance of a magistrate. If I present this singular letter of Mr.
      Maxwell, with the contents of which I have become so unexpectedly
      acquainted, I shall only share his captivity.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And if you apply to a magistrate, young man, you will bring ruin on these
      hospitable ladies, to whom, in all human probability, you owe your life.
      You cannot obtain a warrant for your purpose, without giving a clear
      detail of all the late scenes through which you have passed. A magistrate
      would oblige you to give a complete account of yourself, before arming you
      with his authority against a third party; and in giving such an account,
      the safety of these ladies will necessarily be compromised. A hundred
      spies have had, and still have, their eyes upon this mansion; but God will
      protect his own.&rsquo;&mdash;He crossed himself devoutly, and then proceeded,&mdash;&lsquo;You
      can take an hour to think of your best plan, and I will pledge myself to
      forward it thus far, provided it be not asking you to rely more on my word
      than your prudence can warrant. You shall go to Redgauntlet,&mdash;I name
      him plainly, to show my confidence in you,&mdash;and you shall deliver him
      this letter of Mr. Maxwell&rsquo;s, with one from me, in which I will enjoin him
      to set your friend at liberty, or at least to make no attempts upon your
      own person, either by detention or otherwise. If you can trust me thus
      far,&rsquo; he said, with a proud emphasis on the words &lsquo;I will on my side see
      you depart from this place with the most perfect confidence that you will
      not return armed with powers to drag its inmates to destruction. You are
      young and inexperienced&mdash;bred to a profession also which sharpens
      suspicion, and gives false views of human nature. I have seen much of the
      world, and have known better than most men how far mutual confidence is
      requisite in managing affairs of consequence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with an air of superiority, even of authority, by which Fairford,
      notwithstanding his own internal struggles, was silenced and overawed so
      much, that it was not till the father had turned to leave the apartment
      that he found words to ask him what the consequences would be, should he
      decline to depart on the terms proposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must then, for the safety of all parties, remain for some days an
      inhabitant of Fairladies, where we have the means of detaining you, which
      self-preservation will in that case compel us to make use of. Your
      captivity will be short; for matters cannot long remain as they are. The
      cloud must soon rise, or it must sink upon us for ever. BENEDICITE!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words he left the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fairford, upon his departure, felt himself much at a loss what course to
      pursue. His line of education, as well as his father&rsquo;s tenets in matters
      of church and state, had taught him a holy horror for Papists, and a
      devout belief in whatever had been said of the Punic faith of Jesuits, and
      of the expedients of mental reservation by which the Catholic priests in
      general were supposed to evade keeping faith with heretics. Yet there was
      something of majesty, depressed indeed and overclouded, but still grand
      and imposing, in the manner and words of Father Buonaventure, which it was
      difficult to reconcile with those preconceived opinions which imputed
      subtlety and fraud to his sect and order. Above all, Alan was aware that
      if he accepted not his freedom upon the terms offered him, he was likely
      to be detained by force; so that, in every point of view, he was a gainer
      by accepting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A qualm, indeed, came across him, when he considered, as a lawyer, that
      this father was probably, in the eye of law, a traitor; and that there was
      an ugly crime on the Statute Book, called misprision of treason. On the
      other hand, whatever he might think or suspect, he could not take upon him
      to say that the man was a priest, whom he had never seen in the dress of
      his order, or in the act of celebrating mass; so that he felt himself at
      liberty to doubt of that respecting which he possessed no legal proof. He
      therefore arrived at the conclusion, that he would do well to accept his
      liberty, and proceed to Redgauntlet under the guarantee of Father
      Buonaventure, which he scarce doubted would be sufficient to save him from
      personal inconvenience. Should he once obtain speech of that gentleman, he
      felt the same confidence as formerly, that he might be able to convince
      him of the rashness of his conduct, should he not consent to liberate
      Darsie Latimer. At all events, he should learn where his friend was, and
      how circumstanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thus made up his mind, Alan waited anxiously for the expiration of
      the hour which had been allowed him for deliberation. He was not kept on
      the tenter-hooks of impatience an instant longer than the appointed moment
      arrived, for, even as the clock struck, Ambrose appeared at the door of
      the gallery, and made a sign that Alan should follow him. He did so, and
      after passing through some of the intricate avenues common in old houses,
      was ushered into a small apartment, commodiously fitted up, in which he
      found Father Buonaventure reclining on a couch, in the attitude of a man
      exhausted by fatigue or indisposition. On a small table beside him, a
      silver embossed salver sustained a Catholic book of prayer, a small flask
      of medicine, a cordial, and a little tea-cup of old china. Ambrose did not
      enter the room&mdash;he only bowed profoundly, and closed the door with
      the least possible noise, so soon as Fairford had entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sit down, young man,&rsquo; said the father, with the same air of condescension
      which had before surprised, and rather offended Fairford. &lsquo;You have been
      ill, and I know too well by my own case that indisposition requires
      indulgence. Have you,&rsquo; he continued, so soon as he saw him seated,
      &lsquo;resolved to remain, or to depart?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To depart,&rsquo; said Alan, &lsquo;under the agreement that you will guarantee my
      safety with the extraordinary person who has conducted himself in such a
      lawless manner toward my friend, Darsie Latimer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not judge hastily, young man,&rsquo; replied the father. &lsquo;Redgauntlet has
      the claims of a guardian over his ward, in respect to the young gentleman,
      and a right to dictate his place of residence, although he may have been
      injudicious in selecting the means by which he thinks to enforce his
      authority.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His situation as an attainted person abrogates such rights,&rsquo; said
      Fairford, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Surely,&rsquo; replied the priest, smiling at the young lawyer&rsquo;s readiness; &lsquo;in
      the eye of those who acknowledge the justice of the attainder&mdash;but
      that do not I. However, sir, here is the guarantee&mdash;look at its
      contents, and do not again carry the letters of Uriah.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fairford read these words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;GOOD FRIEND, &lsquo;We send you hither a young man desirous to know the
      situation of your ward, since he came under your paternal authority, and
      hopeful of dealing with you for having your relative put at large. This we
      recommend to your prudence, highly disapproving, at the same time, of any
      force or coercion when such can be avoided, and wishing, therefore, that
      the bearer&rsquo;s negotiation may be successful. At all rates, however, the
      bearer hath our pledged word for his safety and freedom, which, therefore,
      you are to see strictly observed, as you value our honour and your own. We
      further wish to converse with you, with as small loss of time as may be,
      having matters of the utmost confidence to impart. For this purpose we
      desire you to repair hither with all haste, and thereupon we bid you
      heartily farewell. P. B.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will understand, sir,&rsquo; said the father, when he saw that Alan had
      perused his letter, &lsquo;that, by accepting charge of this missive, you bind
      yourself to try the effect of it before having recourse to any legal
      means, as you term them, for your friend&rsquo;s release.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There are a few ciphers added to this letter,&rsquo; said Fairford, when he had
      perused the paper attentively,&mdash;&lsquo;may I inquire what their import is?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They respect my own affairs,&rsquo; answered the father, briefly; &lsquo;and have no
      concern whatever with yours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It seems to me, however,&rsquo; replied Alan, &lsquo;natural to suppose&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing must be supposed incompatible with my honour,&rsquo; replied the
      priest, interrupting him; &lsquo;when such as I am confer favours, we expect
      that they shall be accepted with gratitude, or declined with thankful
      respect&mdash;not questioned or discussed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will accept your letter, then,&rsquo; said Fairford, after a minute&rsquo;s
      consideration, &lsquo;and the thanks you expect shall be most liberally paid, if
      the result answer what you teach me to expect.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God only commands the issue,&rsquo; said Father Buonaventure. &lsquo;Man uses means.
      You understand that, by accepting this commission, you engage yourself in
      honour to try the effect of my letter upon Mr. Redgauntlet, before you
      have recourse to informations or legal warrants?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hold myself bound, as a man of good faith and honour, to do so,&rsquo; said
      Fairford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I trust you,&rsquo; said the father. &lsquo;I will now tell you that an
      express, dispatched by me last night, has, I hear, brought Redgauntlet to
      a spot many miles nearer this place, where he will not find it safe to
      attempt any violence on your friend, should he be rash enough to follow
      the advice of Mr. Maxwell of Summertrees rather than my commands. We now
      understand each other.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He extended his hand towards Alan, who was about to pledge his faith in
      the usual form by grasping it with his own, when the father drew back
      hastily. Ere Alan had time to comment upon this repulse, a small
      side-door, covered with tapestry, was opened; the hangings were drawn
      aside, and a lady, as if by sudden apparition, glided into the apartment.
      It was neither of the Misses Arthuret, but a woman in the prime of life,
      and in the full-blown expansion of female beauty, tall, fair, and
      commanding in her aspect. Her locks, of paly gold, were taught to fall
      over a brow, which, with the stately glance of the large, open, blue eyes,
      might have become Juno herself; her neck and bosom were admirably formed,
      and of a dazzling whiteness. She was rather inclined to EMBONPOINT, but
      not more than became her age, of apparently thirty years. Her step was
      that of a queen, but it was of Queen Vashti, not Queen Esther&mdash;the
      bold and commanding, not the retiring beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Buonaventure raised himself on the couch, angrily, as if displeased
      by this intrusion. &lsquo;How now, madam,&rsquo; he said, with some sternness; &lsquo;why
      have we the honour of your company?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because it is my pleasure,&rsquo; answered the lady, composedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your pleasure, madam!&rsquo; he repeated in the same angry tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My pleasure, sir,&rsquo; she continued, &lsquo;which always keeps exact pace with my
      duty. I had heard you were unwell&mdash;let me hope it is only business
      which produces this seclusion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am well,&rsquo; he replied; &lsquo;perfectly well, and I thank you for your care&mdash;but
      we are not alone, and this young man&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That young man?&rsquo; she said, bending her large and serious eye on Alan
      Fairford, as if she had been for the first time aware of his presence,&mdash;&lsquo;may
      I ask who he is?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Another time, madam; you shall learn his history after he is gone. His
      presence renders it impossible for me to explain further.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;After he is gone may be too late,&rsquo; said the lady; &lsquo;and what is his
      presence to me, when your safety is at stake? He is the heretic lawyer
      whom those silly fools, the Arthurets, admitted into this house at a time
      when they should have let their own father knock at the door in vain,
      though the night had been a wild one. You will not surely dismiss him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your own impatience can alone make that step perilous,&rsquo; said the father;
      &lsquo;I have resolved to take it&mdash;do not let your indiscreet zeal, however
      excellent its motive, add any unnecessary risk to the transaction.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Even so?&rsquo; said the lady, in a tone of reproach, yet mingled with respect
      and apprehension. &lsquo;And thus you will still go forward, like a stag upon
      the hunter&rsquo;s snares, with undoubting confidence, after all that has
      happened?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Peace, madam,&rsquo; said Father Buonaventure, rising up; &lsquo;be silent, or quit
      the apartment; my designs do not admit of female criticism.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To this peremptory command the lady seemed about to make a sharp reply;
      but she checked herself, and pressing her lips strongly together, as if to
      secure the words from bursting from them which were already formed upon
      her tongue, she made a deep reverence, partly as it seemed in reproach,
      partly in respect, and left the room as suddenly as she had entered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father looked disturbed at this incident, which he seemed sensible
      could not but fill Fairford&rsquo;s imagination with an additional throng of
      bewildering suspicions; he bit his lip and muttered something to himself
      as he walked through the apartment; then suddenly turned to his visitor
      with a smile of much sweetness, and a countenance in which every rougher
      expression was exchanged for those of courtesy and kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The visit we have been just honoured with, my young friend, has given
      you,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;more secrets to keep than I would have wished you burdened
      with. The lady is a person of condition&mdash;of rank and fortune&mdash;but
      nevertheless is so circumstanced that the mere fact of her being known to
      be in this country would occasion many evils. I should wish you to observe
      secrecy on this subject, even to Redgauntlet or Maxwell, however much I
      trust them in all that concerns my own affairs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can have no occasion,&rsquo; replied Fairford, &lsquo;for holding any discussion
      with these gentlemen, or with any others, on the circumstance which I have
      just witnessed&mdash;it could only have become the subject of my
      conversation by mere accident, and I will now take care to avoid the
      subject entirely.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will do well, sir, and I thank you,&rsquo; said the father, throwing much
      dignity into the expression of obligation which he meant to convey. &lsquo;The
      time may perhaps come when you will learn what it is to have obliged one
      of my condition. As to the lady, she has the highest merit, and nothing
      can be said of her justly which would not redound to her praise.
      Nevertheless&mdash;in short, sir, we wander at present as in a morning
      mist&mdash;the sun will, I trust, soon rise and dispel it, when all that
      now seems mysterious will be fully revealed&mdash;or it will sink into
      rain,&rsquo; he added, in a solemn tone, &lsquo;and then explanation will be of little
      consequence.&mdash;Adieu, sir; I wish you well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a graceful obeisance, and vanished through the same side-door by
      which the lady had entered; and Alan thought he heard their voices high in
      dispute in the adjoining apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently afterwards, Ambrose entered, and told him that a horse and guide
      waited him beneath the terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The good Father Buonaventure,&rsquo; added the butler, &lsquo;has been graciously
      pleased to consider your situation, and desired me to inquire whether you
      have any occasion for a supply of money?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Make my respects to his reverence,&rsquo; answered Fairford, &lsquo;and assure him I
      am provided in that particular. I beg you also to make my acknowledgements
      to the Misses Arthuret, and assure them that their kind hospitality, to
      which I probably owe my life, shall be remembered with gratitude as long
      as that life lasts. You yourself, Mr. Ambrose, must accept of my kindest
      thanks for your skill and attention.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mid these acknowledgements they left the house, descended the terrace, and
      reached the spot where the gardener, Fairford&rsquo;s old acquaintance, waited
      for him, mounted upon one horse and leading another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bidding adieu to Ambrose, our young lawyer mounted, and rode down the
      avenue, often looking back to the melancholy and neglected dwelling in
      which he had witnessed such strange scenes, and musing upon the character
      of its mysterious inmates, especially the noble and almost regal-seeming
      priest, and the beautiful but capricious dame, who, if she was really
      Father Buonaventure&rsquo;s penitent, seemed less docile to the authority of the
      church than, as Alan conceived, the Catholic discipline permitted. He
      could not indeed help being sensible that the whole deportment of these
      persons differed much from his preconceived notions of a priest and
      devotee. Father Buonaventure, in particular, had more natural dignify and
      less art and affectation in his manner, than accorded with the idea which
      Calvinists were taught to entertain of that wily and formidable person, a
      Jesuitical missionary.
    </p>
    <p>
      While reflecting on these things, he looked back so frequently at the
      house, that Dick Gardener, a forward, talkative fellow, who began to tire
      of silence, at length said to him, &lsquo;I think you will know Fairladies when
      you see it again, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dare say I shall, Richard,&rsquo; answered Fairford good-humouredly. &lsquo;I wish
      I knew as well where I am to go next. But you can tell me, perhaps?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your worship should know better than I,&rsquo; said Dick Gardener;
      &lsquo;nevertheless, I have a notion you are going where all you Scotsmen should
      be sent, whether you will or no.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not to the devil, I hope, good Dick?&rsquo; said Fairford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, no. That is a road which you may travel as heretics; but as
      Scotsmen, I would only send you three-fourths of the way&mdash;and that is
      back to Scotland again&mdash;always craving your honour&rsquo;s pardon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does our journey lie that way?&rsquo; said Fairford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As far as the waterside,&rsquo; said Richard. &lsquo;I am to carry you to old Father
      Crackenthorp&rsquo;s, and then you are within a spit and a stride of Scotland,
      as the saying is. But mayhap you may think twice of going thither, for all
      that; for Old England is fat feeding-ground for north-country cattle.&rsquo;

      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      NARRATIVE OF DARSIE LATIMER
    </h3>
    <p>
      Our history must now, as the old romancers wont to say, &lsquo;leave to tell&rsquo; of
      the quest of Alan Fairford, and instruct our readers of the adventures
      which befell Darsie Latimer, left as he was in the precarious custody of
      his self-named tutor, the Laird of the Lochs of Solway, to whose arbitrary
      pleasure he found it necessary for the present to conform himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In consequence of this prudent resolution, and although he did not assume
      such a disguise without some sensations of shame and degradation, Darsie
      permitted Cristal Nixon to place over his face, and secure by a string,
      one of those silk masks which ladies frequently wore to preserve their
      complexions, when exposed to the air during long journeys on horseback. He
      remonstrated somewhat more vehemently against the long riding-skirt, which
      converted his person from the waist into the female guise, but was obliged
      to concede this point also.
    </p>
    <p>
      The metamorphosis was then complete; for the fair reader must be informed,
      that in those rude times, the ladies, when they honoured the masculine
      dress by assuming any part of it, wore just such hats, coats, and
      waistcoats as the male animals themselves made use of, and had no notion
      of the elegant compromise betwixt male and female attire, which has now
      acquired, PAR EXCELLENCE, the name of a HABIT. Trolloping things our
      mothers must have looked, with long square-cut coats, lacking collars, and
      with waistcoats plentifully supplied with a length of pocket, which hung
      far downwards from the middle. But then they had some advantage from the
      splendid colours, lace, and gay embroidery which masculine attire then
      exhibited; and, as happens in many similar instances, the finery of the
      materials made amends for the want of symmetry and grace of form in the
      garments themselves. But this is a digression.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the court of the old mansion, half manor-place, half farm-house, or
      rather a decayed manor-house, converted into an abode for a Cumberland
      tenant, stood several saddled horses. Four or five of them were mounted by
      servants or inferior retainers, all of whom were well armed with sword,
      pistol, and carabine. But two had riding furniture for the use of females&mdash;the
      one being accoutred with a side-saddle, the other with a pillion attached
      to the saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darsie&rsquo;s heart beat quicker within him; he easily comprehended that one of
      these was intended for his own use; and his hopes suggested that the other
      was designed for that of the fair Green Mantle, whom, according to his
      established practice, he had adopted for the queen of his affections,
      although his opportunities of holding communication with her had not
      exceeded the length of a silent supper on one occasion, and the going down
      a country-dance on another. This, however, was no unwonted mood of passion
      with Darsie Latimer, upon whom Cupid was used to triumph only in the
      degree of a Mahratta conqueror, who overruns a province with the rapidity
      of lightning, but finds it impossible to retain it beyond a very brief
      space. Yet this new love was rather more serious than the scarce
      skinned-up wounds which his friend Fairford used to ridicule. The damsel
      had shown a sincere interest in his behalf; and the air of mystery with
      which that interest was veiled, gave her, to his lively imagination, the
      character of a benevolent and protecting spirit, as much as that of a
      beautiful female.
    </p>
    <p>
      At former times, the romance attending his short-lived attachments had
      been of his own creating, and had disappeared as soon as ever he
      approached more closely to the object with which he had invested it. On
      the present occasion, it really flowed from external circumstances, which
      might have interested less susceptible feelings, and an imagination less
      lively than that of Darsie Latimer, young, inexperienced, and enthusiastic
      as he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched, therefore, anxiously to whose service the palfrey bearing the
      lady&rsquo;s saddle was destined. But ere any female appeared to occupy it, he
      was himself summoned to take his seat on the pillion behind Cristal Nixon,
      amid the grins of his old acquaintance Jan who helped him to horse, and
      the unrestrained laughter of Cicely, who displayed on the occasion a case
      of teeth which might have rivalled ivory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Latimer was at an age when being an object of general ridicule even to
      clowns and milkmaids was not a matter of indifference, and he longed
      heartily to have laid his horse-whip across Jan&rsquo;s shoulders. That,
      however, was a solacement of his feelings which was not at the moment to
      be thought of; and Cristal Nixon presently put an end to his unpleasant
      situation, by ordering the riders to go on. He himself kept the centre of
      the troop, two men riding before and two behind him, always, as it seemed
      to Darsie, having their eye upon him, to prevent any attempt to escape. He
      could see from time to time, when the straight line of the road, or the
      advantage of an ascent permitted him, that another troop of three or four
      riders followed them at about a quarter of a mile&rsquo;s distance, amongst whom
      he could discover the tall form of Redgauntlet, and the powerful action of
      his gallant black horse. He had little doubt that Green Mantle made one of
      the party, though he was unable to distinguish her from the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this manner they travelled from six in the morning until nearly ten of
      the clock, without Darsie exchanging a word with any one; for he loathed
      the very idea of entering into conversation with Cristal Nixon, against
      whom he seemed to feel an instinctive aversion; nor was that domestic&rsquo;s
      saturnine and sullen disposition such as to have encouraged advances, had
      he thought of making them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the party halted for the purpose of refreshment; but as they had
      hitherto avoided all villages and inhabited places upon their route, so
      they now stopped at one of those large ruinous Dutch barns, which are
      sometimes found in the fields, at a distance from the farm-houses to which
      they belong. Yet in this desolate place some preparations had been made
      for their reception. There were in the end of the barn racks filled with
      provender for the horses, and plenty of provisions for the party were
      drawn from the trusses of straw, under which the baskets that contained
      them had been deposited. The choicest of these were selected and arranged
      apart by Cristal Nixon, while the men of the party threw themselves upon
      the rest, which he abandoned to their discretion. In a few minutes
      afterwards the rearward party arrived and dismounted, and Redgauntlet
      himself entered the barn with the green-mantled maiden by his side. He
      presented her to Darsie with these words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is time you two should know each other better. I promised you my
      confidence, Darsie, and the time is come for reposing it. But first we
      will have our breakfast; and then, when once more in the saddle, I will
      tell you that which it is necessary that you should know. Salute Lilias,
      Darsie.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The command was sudden, and surprised Latimer, whose confusion was
      increased by the perfect ease and frankness with which Lilias offered at
      once her cheek and her hand, and pressing his as she rather took it than
      gave her own, said very frankly, &lsquo;Dearest Darsie, how rejoiced I am that
      our uncle has at last permitted us to become acquainted!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Darsie&rsquo;s head turned round; and it was perhaps well that Redgauntlet
      called on him to sit down, as even that movement served to hide his
      confusion. There is an old song which says&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &mdash;when ladies are willing,
  A man can but look like a fool;
</pre>
    <p>
      And on the same principle Darsie Latimer&rsquo;s looks at this unexpected
      frankness of reception, would have formed an admirable vignette for
      illustrating the passage. &lsquo;Dearest Darsie,&rsquo; and such a ready, nay, eager
      salute of lip and hand! It was all very gracious, no doubt&mdash;and ought
      to have been received with much gratitude; but, constituted as our
      friend&rsquo;s temper was, nothing could be more inconsistent with his tone of
      feeling. If a hermit had proposed to him to club for a pot of beer, the
      illusion of his reverend sanctity could not have been dispelled more
      effectually than the divine qualities of Green Mantle faded upon the
      ill-imagined frank-heartedness of poor Lilias. Vexed with her forwardness,
      and affronted at having once more cheated himself, Darsie could hardly
      help muttering two lines of the song we have already quoted:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  The fruit that must fall without shaking
  Is rather too mellow for me.
</pre>
    <p>
      And yet it was pity for her too&mdash;she was a very pretty young woman&mdash;his
      fancy had scarcely overrated her in that respect&mdash;and the slight
      derangement of the beautiful brown locks which escaped in natural ringlets
      from under her riding-hat, with the bloom which exercise had brought into
      her cheek, made her even more than usually fascinating. Redgauntlet
      modified the sternness of his look when it was turned towards her, and in
      addressing her, used a softer tone than his usual deep bass. Even the grim
      features of Cristal Nixon relaxed when he attended on her, and it was
      then, if ever, that his misanthropical visage expressed some sympathy with
      the rest of humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can she,&rsquo; thought Latimer, &lsquo;look so like an angel, yet be so mere a
      mortal after all? How could so much seeming modesty have so much
      forwardness of manner, when she ought to have been most reserved? How can
      her conduct be reconciled to the grace and ease of her general
      deportment?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The confusion of thoughts which occupied Darsie&rsquo;s imagination, gave to his
      looks a disordered appearance, and his inattention to the food which was
      placed before him, together with his silence and absence of mind, induced
      Lilias solicitously to inquire, whether he did not feel some return of the
      disorder under which he had suffered so lately. This led Mr. Redgauntlet,
      who seemed also lost in his own contemplations, to raise his eyes, and
      join in the same inquiry with some appearance of interest. Latimer
      explained to both that he was perfectly well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is well it is so,&rsquo; answered Redgauntlet; &lsquo;for we have that before us
      which will brook no delay from indisposition&mdash;we have not, as Hotspur
      says, leisure to be sick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lilias, on her part, endeavoured to prevail upon Darsie to partake of the
      food which she offered him, with a kindly and affectionate courtesy
      corresponding to the warmth of the interest she had displayed at their
      meeting; but so very natural, innocent, and pure in its character, that it
      would have been impossible for the vainest coxcomb to have mistaken it for
      coquetry, or a desire of captivating a prize so valuable as his affection.
      Darsie, with no more than the reasonable share of self-opinion common to
      most youths when they approach twenty-one, knew not how to explain her
      conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes he was tempted to think that his own merits had, even during the
      short intervals when they had seen each other, secured such a hold of the
      affections of a young person who had probably been bred up in ignorance of
      the world and its forms that she was unable to conceal her partiality.
      Sometimes he suspected that she acted by her guardian&rsquo;s order, who, aware
      that he, Darsie, was entitled to a considerable fortune, might have taken
      this bold stroke to bring about a marriage betwixt him and so near a
      relative.
    </p>
    <p>
      But neither of these suppositions was applicable to the character of the
      parties. Miss Lilias&rsquo;s manners, however soft and natural, displayed in
      their ease and versatility considerable acquaintance with the habits of
      the world, and in the few words she said during the morning repast, there
      were mingled a shrewdness and good sense, which could scarce belong to a
      miss capable of playing the silly part of a love-smitten maiden so
      broadly. As for Redgauntlet, with his stately bearing, his fatal frown,
      his eye of threat and of command, it was impossible, Darsie thought, to
      suspect him of a scheme having private advantage for its object; he could
      as soon have imagined Cassius picking Caesar&rsquo;s pocket, instead of drawing
      his poniard on the dictator.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he thus mused, unable either to eat, drink, or answer to the
      courtesy of Lilias, she soon ceased to speak to him, and sat silent as
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had remained nearly an hour in their halting-place, when Redgauntlet
      said aloud, &lsquo;Look out, Cristal Nixon. If we hear nothing from Fairladies,
      we must continue our journey.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cristal went to the door, and presently returned and said to his master,
      in a voice as harsh as his features, &lsquo;Gilbert Gregson is coming, his horse
      as white with foam as if a fiend had ridden him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Redgauntlet threw from him the plate on which he had been eating, and
      hastened towards the door of the barn, which the courier at that moment
      entered; a smart jockey with a black velvet hunting-cap, and a broad belt
      drawn tight round his waist, to which was secured his express-bag. The
      variety of mud with which he was splashed from cap to spur showed he had
      had a rough and rapid ride. He delivered a letter to Mr. Redgauntlet, with
      an obeisance, and then retired to the end of the barn, where the other
      attendants were sitting or lying upon the straw, in order to get some
      refreshment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Redgauntlet broke the letter open with haste, and read it with anxious and
      discomposed looks. On a second perusal, his displeasure seemed to
      increase, his brow darkened, and was distinctly marked with the fatal sign
      peculiar to his family and house. Darsie had never before observed his
      frown bear such a close resemblance to the shape which tradition assigned
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Redgauntlet held out the open letter with one hand, and struck it with the
      forefinger of the other, as, in a suppressed and displeased tone, he said
      to Cristal Nixon, &lsquo;Countermanded&mdash;ordered northward once more!
      &lsquo;Northward, when all our hopes lie to the south&mdash;a second Derby
      direction, when we turned our back on glory, and marched in quest of
      ruin!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cristal Nixon took the letter and ran it over, then returned it to his
      master with the cold observation, &lsquo;A female influence predominates.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But it shall predominate no longer,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet; &lsquo;it shall wane as
      ours rises in the horizon. Meanwhile, I will on before&mdash;and you,
      Cristal, will bring the party to the place assigned in the letter. You may
      now permit the young persons to have unreserved communication together;
      only mark that you watch the young man closely enough to prevent his
      escape, if he should be idiot enough to attempt it, but not approaching so
      close as to watch their free conversation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I care naught about their conversation,&rsquo; said Nixon, surlily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You hear my commands, Lilias,&rsquo; said the laird, turning to the young lady.
      &lsquo;You may use my permission and authority to explain so much of our family
      matters as you yourself know. At our next meeting I will complete the task
      of disclosure, and I trust I shall restore one Redgauntlet more to the
      bosom of our ancient family. Let Latimer, as he calls himself, have a
      horse to himself; he must for some time retain his disguise.&mdash;My
      horse&mdash;my horse!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In two minutes they heard him ride off from the door of the barn, followed
      at speed by two of the armed men of his party.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commands of Cristal Nixon, in the meanwhile, put all the remainder of
      the party in motion, but the laird himself was long out of sight ere they
      were in readiness to resume their journey. When at length they set out,
      Darsie was accommodated with a horse and side-saddle, instead of being
      obliged to resume his place on the pillion behind the detestable Nixon. He
      was obliged, however, to retain his riding-skirt, and to reassume his
      mask. Yet, notwithstanding this disagreeable circumstance, and although he
      observed that they gave him the heaviest and slowest horse of the party,
      and that, as a further precaution against escape, he was closely watched
      on every side, yet riding in company with the pretty Lilias was an
      advantage which overbalanced these inconveniences.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true that this society, to which that very morning he would have
      looked forward as a glimpse of heaven, had, now that it was thus
      unexpectedly indulged, something much less rapturous than he had expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in vain that, in order to avail himself of a situation so
      favourable for indulging his romantic disposition, he endeavoured to coax
      back, if I may so express myself, that delightful dream of ardent and
      tender passion; he felt only such a confusion of ideas at the difference
      between the being whom he had imagined, and her with whom he was now in
      contact, that it seemed to him like the effect of witchcraft. What most
      surprised him was, that this sudden flame should have died away so
      rapidly, notwithstanding that the maiden&rsquo;s personal beauty was even
      greater than he had expected&mdash;her demeanour, unless it should be
      deemed over kind towards himself, as graceful and becoming as he could
      have fancied if, even in his gayest dreams. It were judging hardly of him
      to suppose that the mere belief of his having attracted her affections
      more easily than he expected was the cause of his ungratefully
      undervaluing a prize too lightly won, or that his transient passion played
      around his heart with the hitting radiance of a wintry sunbeam flashing
      against an icicle, which may brighten it for a moment, but cannot melt it.
      Neither of these was precisely the ease, though such fickleness of
      disposition might also have some influence in the change.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth is, perhaps, the lover&rsquo;s pleasure, like that of the hunter, is
      in the chase; and that the brightest beauty loses half its merit, as the
      fairest flower its perfume, when the willing hand can reach it too easily.
      There must be doubt&mdash;there must be danger&mdash;there must be
      difficulty; and if, as the poet says, the course of ardent affection never
      does run smooth, it is perhaps because, without some intervening obstacle,
      that which is called the romantic passion of love, in its high poetical
      character and colouring can hardly have an existence&mdash;any more than
      there can be a current in a river without the stream being narrowed by
      steep banks, or checked by opposing rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let not those, however, who enter into a union for life without those
      embarrassments which delight a Darsie Latimer, or a Lydia Languish, and
      which are perhaps necessary to excite an enthusiastic passion in breasts
      more firm than theirs, augur worse of their future happiness because their
      own alliance is formed under calmer auspices. Mutual esteem, an intimate
      knowledge of each other&rsquo;s character, seen, as in their case, undisguised
      by the mists of too partial passion&mdash;a suitable proportion of parties
      in rank and fortune, in taste and pursuits&mdash;are more frequently found
      in a marriage of reason, than in a union of romantic attachment; where the
      imagination, which probably created the virtues and accomplishments with
      which it invested the beloved object, is frequently afterwards employed in
      magnifying the mortifying consequences of its own delusion, and
      exasperating all the stings of disappointment. Those who follow the
      banners of Reason are like the well-disciplined battalion, which, wearing
      a more sober uniform and making a less dazzling show than the light troops
      commanded by imagination, enjoy more safety, and even more honour, in the
      conflicts of human life. All this, however, is foreign to our present
      purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncertain in what manner to address her whom he had been lately so anxious
      to meet with, and embarrassed by a TETE-A-TETE to which his own timid
      inexperience, gave some awkwardness, the party had proceeded more than a
      hundred yards before Darsie assumed courage to accost, or even to look at,
      his companion. Sensible, however, of the impropriety of his silence, he
      turned to speak to her; and observing that, although she wore her mask,
      there was something like disappointment and dejection in her manner, he
      was moved by self-reproach for his own coldness, and hastened to address
      her in the kindest tone he could assume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must think me cruelly deficient in gratitude, Miss Lilias, that I
      have been thus long in your company, without thanking you for the interest
      which you have deigned to take in my unfortunate affairs?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am glad you have at length spoken,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;though I owe it is more
      coldly than I expected. MISS Lilias! DEIGN to take interest! In whom, dear
      Darsie, CAN I take interest but in you; and why do you put this barrier of
      ceremony betwixt us, whom adverse circumstances have already separated for
      such a length of time?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Darsie was again confounded at the extra candour, if we may use the term,
      of this frank avowal. &lsquo;One must love partridge very well,&rsquo; thought he, &lsquo;to
      accept it when thrown in one&rsquo;s face&mdash;if this is not plain speaking,
      there is no such place as downright Dunstable in being!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Embarrassed with these reflections, and himself of a nature fancifully,
      almost fastidiously, delicate, he could only in reply stammer forth an
      acknowledgement of his companion&rsquo;s goodness, and his own gratitude. She
      answered in a tone partly sorrowful and partly impatient, repeating, with
      displeased emphasis, the only distinct words he had been able to bring
      forth&mdash;&lsquo;Goodness&mdash;gratitude!&mdash;O Darsie! should these be the
      phrases between you and me? Alas! I am too sure you are displeased with
      me, though I cannot even guess on what account. Perhaps you think I have
      been too free in venturing upon my visit to your friend. But then
      remember, it was in your behalf, and that I knew no better way to put you
      on your guard against the misfortunes and restraint which you have been
      subjected to, and are still enduring.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear Lady&rsquo;&mdash;said Darsie, rallying his recollection, and suspicious
      of some error in apprehension,&mdash;a suspicion which his mode of address
      seemed at once to communicate to Lilias, for she interrupted him,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;LADY! dear LADY! For whom, or for what, in Heaven&rsquo;s name, do you take me,
      that you address me so formally?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Had the question been asked in that enchanted hall in fairyland, where all
      interrogations must be answered with absolute sincerity, Darsie had
      certainly replied, that he took her for the most frank-hearted and
      ultra-liberal lass that had ever lived since Mother Eve eat the pippin
      without paring. But as he was still on middle-earth, and free to avail
      himself of a little polite deceit, he barely answered that he believed he
      had the honour of speaking to the niece of Mr. Redgauntlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Surely,&rsquo; she replied; &lsquo;but were it not as easy for you to have said, to
      your own only sister?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Darsie started in his saddle, as if he had received a pistol-shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My sister!&rsquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you did NOT know it, then?&rsquo; said she. &lsquo;I thought your reception of me
      was cold and indifferent!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A kind and cordial embrace took place betwixt the relatives; and so light
      was Darsie&rsquo;s spirit, that he really felt himself more relieved, by getting
      quit of the embarrassments of the last half-hour, during which he
      conceived himself in danger of being persecuted by the attachment of a
      forward girl, than disappointed by the vanishing of so many day-dreams as
      he had been in the habit of encouraging during the time when the
      green-mantled maiden was goddess of his idolatry. He had been already
      flung from his romantic Pegasus, and was too happy at length to find
      himself with bones unbroken, though with his back on the ground. He was,
      besides, with all his whims and follies, a generous, kind-hearted youth,
      and was delighted to acknowledge so beautiful and amiable a relative, and
      to assure her in the warmest terms of his immediate affection and future
      protection, so soon as they should be extricated from their present
      situation. Smiles and tears mingled on Lilias&rsquo;s cheeks, like showers and
      sunshine in April weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Out on me,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;that I should be so childish as to cry at what
      makes me so sincerely happy! since, God knows, family-love is what my
      heart has most longed after, and to which it has been most a stranger. My
      uncle says that you and I, Darsie, are but half Redgauntlets, and that the
      metal of which our father&rsquo;s family was made, has been softened to
      effeminacy in our mother&rsquo;s offspring.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; said Darsie, &lsquo;I know so little of our family story, that I almost
      doubted that I belonged to the House of Redgauntlet, although the chief of
      the family himself intimated so much to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The chief of the family!&rsquo; said Lilias. &lsquo;You must know little of your own
      descent indeed, if you mean my uncle by that expression. You yourself, my
      dear Darsie, are the heir and representative of our ancient House, for our
      father was the elder brother&mdash;that brave and unhappy Sir Henry Darsie
      Redgauntlet, who suffered at Carlisle in the year 1746. He took the name
      of Darsie, in conjunction with his own, from our mother, heiress to a
      Cumberland family of great wealth and antiquity, of whose large estates
      you are the undeniable heir, although those of your father have been
      involved in the general doom of forfeiture. But all this must be
      necessarily unknown to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed I hear it for the first time in my life,&rsquo; answered Darsie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you knew not that I was your sister?&rsquo; said Lilias. &lsquo;No wonder you
      received me so coldly. What a strange, wild, forward young person you must
      have thought me&mdash;mixing myself in the fortunes of a stranger whom I
      had only once spoken to&mdash;corresponding with him by signs&mdash;Good
      Heaven! what can you have supposed me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how should I have come to the knowledge of our connexion?&rsquo; said
      Darsie. &lsquo;You are aware I was not acquainted with it when we danced
      together at Brokenburn.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I saw that with concern, and fain I would have warned you,&rsquo; answered
      Lilias; &lsquo;but I was closely watched, and before I could find or make an
      opportunity of coming to a full explanation with you on a subject so
      agitating, I was forced to leave the room. What I did say was, you may
      remember, a caution to leave the southern border, for I foresaw what has
      since happened. But since my uncle has had you in his power, I never
      doubted he had communicated to you our whole family history.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has left me to learn it from you, Lilias; and assure yourself that I
      will hear it with more pleasure from your lips than from his. I have no
      reason to be pleased with his conduct towards me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of that,&rsquo; said Lilias, &lsquo;you will judge better when you have heard what I
      have to tell you;&rsquo; and she began her communication in the following
      manner.

      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      NARRATIVE OF DARSIE LATIMER, CONTINUED
    </h3>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The House of Redgauntlet,&rsquo; said the young lady, &lsquo;has for centuries been
      supposed to lie under a doom, which has rendered vain their courage, their
      talents, their ambition, and their wisdom. Often making a figure in
      history, they have been ever in the situation of men striving against both
      wind and tide, who distinguish themselves by their desperate exertions of
      strength, and their persevering endurance of toil, but without being able
      to advance themselves upon their course by either vigour or resolution.
      They pretend to trace this fatality to a legendary history, which I may
      tell you at a less busy moment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Darsie intimated that he had already heard the tragic story of Sir
      Alberick Redgauntlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I need only say, then,&rsquo; proceeded Lilias, &lsquo;that our father and uncle felt
      the family doom in its full extent. They were both possessed of
      considerable property, which was largely increased by our father&rsquo;s
      marriage, and were both devoted to the service of the unhappy House of
      Stuart; but (as our mother at least supposed) family considerations might
      have withheld her husband from joining openly in the affair of 1745, had
      not the high influence which the younger brother possessed over the elder,
      from his more decided energy of character, hurried him along with himself
      into that undertaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When, therefore, the enterprise came to the fatal conclusion which
      bereaved our father of his life and consigned his brother to exile, Lady
      Redgauntlet fled from the north of England, determined to break off all
      communication with her late husband&rsquo;s family, particularly his brother,
      whom she regarded as having, by their insane political enthusiasm, been
      the means of his untimely death; and determined that you, my brother, an
      infant, and that I, to whom she had just given birth, should be brought up
      as adherents of the present dynasty. Perhaps she was too hasty in this
      determination&mdash;too timidly anxious to exclude, if possible, from the
      knowledge of the very spot where we existed, a relation so nearly
      connected with us as our father&rsquo;s only brother. But you must make
      allowance for what she had suffered. See, brother,&rsquo; she said, pulling her
      glove off, &lsquo;these five blood-specks on my arm are a mark by which
      mysterious Nature has impressed, on an unborn infant, a record of its
      father&rsquo;s violent death and its mother&rsquo;s miseries.&rsquo; [Several persons have
      brought down to these days the impressions which Nature had thus recorded,
      when they were yet babes unborn. One lady of quality, whose father was
      long under sentence of death previous to the Rebellion, was marked on the
      back of the neck by the sign of a broad axe. Another whose kinsmen had
      been slain in battle and died on the scaffold to the number of seven, bore
      a child spattered on the right shoulder and down the arm with scarlet
      drops, as if of blood. Many other instances might be quoted.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You were not, then, born when my father suffered?&rsquo; said Darsie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alas, no!&rsquo; she replied; &lsquo;nor were you a twelvemonth old. It was no wonder
      that my mother, after going through such scenes of agony, became
      irresistibly anxious for the sake of her children&mdash;of her son in
      particular; the more especially as the late Sir Henry, her husband, had,
      by a settlement of his affairs, confided the custody of the persons of her
      children, as well as the estates which descended to them, independently of
      those which fell under his forfeiture, to his brother Hugh, in whom he
      placed unlimited confidence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But my mother had no reason to fear the operation of such a deed,
      conceived in favour of an attainted man,&rsquo; said Darsie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;True,&rsquo; replied Lilias; &lsquo;but our uncle&rsquo;s attainder might have been
      reversed, like that of so many other persons, and our mother, who both
      feared and hated him, lived in continual terror that this would be the
      case, and that she should see the author, as she thought him, of her
      husband&rsquo;s death come armed with legal powers, and in a capacity to use
      them for the purpose of tearing her children from her protection. Besides,
      she feared, even in his incapacitated condition, the adventurous and
      pertinacious spirit of her brother-in-law, Hugh Redgauntlet, and felt
      assured that he would make some attempt to possess himself of the persons
      of the children. On the other hand, our uncle, whose proud disposition
      might, perhaps, have been soothed by the offer of her confidence, revolted
      against the distrustful and suspicious manner in which Lady Darsie
      Redgauntlet acted towards him. She basely abused, he said, the unhappy
      circumstances in which he was placed, in order to deprive him of his
      natural privilege of protecting and educating the infants, whom nature and
      law, and the will of their father, had committed to his charge, and he
      swore solemnly he would not submit to such an injury. Report of his
      threats was made to Lady Redgauntlet, and tended to increase those fears
      which proved but too well founded. While you and I, children at that time
      of two or three years old, were playing together in a walled orchard,
      adjacent to our mother&rsquo;s residence which she had fixed somewhere in
      Devonshire, my uncle suddenly scaled the wall with several men, and I was
      snatched up; and carried off to a boat which waited for them. My mother,
      however, flew to your rescue, and as she seized on and held you fast, my
      uncle could not, as he has since told me, possess himself of your person,
      without using unmanly violence to his brother&rsquo;s widow. Of this he was
      incapable; and, as people began to assemble upon my mother&rsquo;s screaming, he
      withdrew, after darting upon you and her one of those fearful looks,
      which, it is said, remain with our family, as a fatal bequest of Sir
      Alberick, our ancestor.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have some recollection of the scuffle which you mention,&rsquo; said Darsie;
      &lsquo;and I think it was my uncle himself (since my uncle he is) who recalled
      the circumstance to my mind on a late occasion. I can now account for the
      guarded seclusion under which my poor mother lived&mdash;for her frequent
      tears, her starts of hysterical alarm, and her constant and deep
      melancholy. Poor lady! what a lot was hers, and what must have been her
      feelings when it approached to a close!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was then that she adopted,&rsquo; said Lilias, &lsquo;every precaution her
      ingenuity could suggest, to keep your very existence concealed from the
      person whom she feared&mdash;nay, from yourself; for she dreaded, as she
      is said often to have expressed herself, that the wildfire blood of
      Redgauntlet would urge you to unite your fortunes to those of your uncle,
      who was well known still to carry on political intrigues, which most other
      persons had considered as desperate. It was also possible that he, as well
      as others, might get his pardon, as government showed every year more
      lenity towards the remnant of the Jacobites, and then he might claim the
      custody of your person, as your legal guardian. Either of these events she
      considered as the direct road to your destruction.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder she had not claimed the protection of Chancery for me,&rsquo; said
      Darsie; &lsquo;or confided me to the care of some powerful friend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She was on indifferent terms with her relations, on account of her
      marriage with our father,&rsquo; said Lilias, &lsquo;and trusted more to secreting you
      from your uncle&rsquo;s attempts, than to any protection which law might afford
      against them. Perhaps she judged unwisely, but surely not unnaturally, for
      one rendered irritable by so many misfortunes and so many alarms. Samuel
      Griffiths, an eminent banker, and a worthy clergyman now dead were, I
      believe, the only persons whom she intrusted with the execution of her
      last will; and my uncle believes that she made them both swear to observe
      profound secrecy concerning your birth and pretensions, until you should
      come to the age of majority, and, in the meantime, to breed you up in the
      most private way possible, and that which was most likely to withdraw you
      from my uncle&rsquo;s observation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I have no doubt,&rsquo; said Darsie, &lsquo;that betwixt change of name and
      habitation, they might have succeeded perfectly, but for the accident&mdash;lucky
      or unlucky, I know not which to term it&mdash;which brought me to
      Brokenburn, and into contact with Mr. Redgauntlet. I see also why I was
      warned against England, for in England&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In England alone, if I understand rightly,&rsquo; said Miss Redgauntlet, &lsquo;the
      claims of your uncle to the custody of your person could have been
      enforced, in case of his being replaced in the ordinary rights of
      citizenship, either by the lenity of the government or by some change in
      it. In Scotland, where you possess no property, I understand his authority
      might; have been resisted, and measures taken to put you under the
      protection of the law. But, pray, think it not unlucky that you have taken
      the step of visiting Brokenburn&mdash;I feel confident that the
      consequences must be ultimately fortunate, for have they not already
      brought us into contact with each other?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, she held out her hand to her brother, who grasped it with a
      fondness of pressure very different from the manner in which they first
      clasped hands that morning. There was a moment&rsquo;s pause, while the hearts
      of both were overflowing with a feeling of natural affection, to which
      circumstances had hitherto rendered them strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length Darsie broke silence; &lsquo;I am ashamed,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;my dearest
      Lilias, that I have suffered you to talk so long about matters concerning
      myself only, while I remain ignorant of your story, and your present
      situation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The former is none of the most interesting, nor the latter the most safe
      or agreeable,&rsquo; answered Lilias; &lsquo;but now, my dearest brother, I shall have
      the inestimable support of your countenance and affection; and were I but
      sure that we could weather the formidable crisis which I find so close at
      hand, I should have little apprehensions for the future.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me know,&rsquo; said Darsie, &lsquo;what our present situation is; and rely upon
      my utmost exertions both in your defence and my own. For what reason can
      my uncle desire to detain me a prisoner? If in mere opposition to the will
      of my mother, she has long been no more; and I see not why he should wish,
      at so much trouble and risk, to interfere with the free will of one, to
      whom a few months will give a privilege of acting for himself, with which
      he will have no longer any pretence to interfere.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dearest Arthur,&rsquo; answered Lilias&mdash;&lsquo;for that name, as well as
      Darsie, properly belongs to you&mdash;it is the leading feature in my
      uncle&rsquo;s character, that he has applied every energy of his powerful mind
      to the service of the exiled family of Stuart. The death of his brother,
      the dilapidation of his own fortunes, have only added to his hereditary
      zeal for the House of Stuart a deep and almost personal hatred against the
      present reigning family. He is, in short, a political enthusiast of the
      most dangerous character, and proceeds in his agency with as much
      confidence, as if he felt himself the very Atlas who is alone capable of
      supporting a sinking cause.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And where or how did you, my Lilias, educated, doubtless, under his
      auspices, learn to have a different view of such subjects?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By a singular chance,&rsquo; replied Lilias, &lsquo;in the nunnery where my uncle
      placed me. Although the abbess was a person exactly after his own heart,
      my education as a pensioner devolved much on an excellent old mother who
      had adopted the tenets of the Jansenists, with perhaps a still further
      tendency towards the reformed doctrines, than those of Port Royal. The
      mysterious secrecy with which she inculcated these tenets, gave them
      charms to my young mind, and I embraced them the rather that they were in
      direct opposition to the doctrines of the abbess, whom I hated so much for
      her severity, that I felt a childish delight in setting her control at
      defiance, and contradicting in my secret soul all that I was openly
      obliged to listen to with reverence. Freedom of religious opinion brings
      on, I suppose, freedom of political creed; for I had no sooner renounced
      the Pope&rsquo;s infallibility, than I began to question the doctrine of
      hereditary and indefeasible right. In short, strange as it may seem, I
      came out of a Parisian convent, not indeed an instructed Whig and
      Protestant, but with as much inclination to be so as if I had been bred
      up, like you, within the Presbyterian sound of Saint Giles&rsquo;s chimes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;More so, perhaps,&rsquo; replied Darsie; &lsquo;for the nearer the church&mdash;the
      proverb is somewhat musty. But how did these liberal opinions of yours
      agree with the very opposite prejudices of my uncle?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They would have agreed like fire and water,&rsquo; answered Lilias, &lsquo;had I
      suffered mine to become visible; but as that would have subjected me to
      constant reproach and upbraiding, or worse, I took great care to keep my
      own secret; so that occasional censures for coldness, and lack of zeal for
      the good cause, were the worst I had to undergo; and these were bad
      enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I applaud your caution,&rsquo; said Darsie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have reason,&rsquo; replied his sister; &lsquo;but I got so terrible a specimen
      of my uncle&rsquo;s determination of character, before I had been acquainted
      with him for much more than a week, that it taught me at what risk I
      should contradict his humour. I will tell you the circumstances; for it
      will better teach you to appreciate the romantic and resolved nature of
      his character, than anything which I could state of his rashness and
      enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;After I had been many a long year at the convent, I was removed from
      thence, and placed with a meagre old Scottish lady of high rank, the
      daughter of an unfortunate person whose head had in the year 1715 been
      placed on Temple Bar. She subsisted on a small pension from the French
      Court, aided by an occasional gratuity from the Stuarts; to which the
      annuity paid for my board formed a desirable addition. She was not
      ill-tempered, nor very covetous&mdash;neither beat me nor starved me&mdash;but
      she was so completely trammelled by rank and prejudices, so awfully
      profound in genealogy, and so bitterly keen, poor lady, in British,
      politics, that I sometimes thought it pity that the Hanoverians, who
      murdered, as she used to tell me, her poor dear father, had left his dear
      daughter in the land of the living. Delighted, therefore, was I, when my
      uncle made his appearance, and abruptly announced his purpose of conveying
      me to England. My extravagant joy at the idea of leaving Lady Rachel
      Rougedragon was somewhat qualified by observing the melancholy look, lofty
      demeanour, and commanding tone of my near relative. He held more
      communication with me on the journey, however, than consisted with his
      taciturn demeanour in general, and seemed anxious to ascertain my tone of
      character, and particularly in point of courage. Now, though I am a tamed
      Redgauntlet, yet I have still so much of our family spirit as enables me
      to be as composed in danger as most of my sex; and upon two occasions in
      the course of our journey&mdash;a threatened attack by banditti, and the
      overturn of our carriage&mdash;I had the fortune so to conduct myself, as
      to convey to my uncle a very favourable idea of my intrepidity. Probably
      this encouraged him to put in execution the singular scheme which he had
      in agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ere we reached London we changed our means of conveyance, and altered the
      route by which we approached the city, more than once; then, like a hare
      which doubles repeatedly at some distance from the seat she means to
      occupy, and at last leaps into her form from a distance so great as she
      can clear by a spring, we made a forced march, and landed in private and
      obscure lodgings in a little old street in Westminster, not far from the
      Cloisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On the morning of the day on which we arrived my uncle went abroad, and
      did not return for some hours. Meantime I had no other amusement than to
      listen to the tumult of noises which succeeded each other, or reigned in
      confusion together during the whole morning. Paris I had thought the most
      noisy capital in the world, but Paris seemed midnight silence compared to
      London. Cannon thundered near and at a distance&mdash;drums, trumpets, and
      military music of every kind, rolled, flourished, and pierced the clouds,
      almost without intermission. To fill up the concert, bells pealed
      incessantly from a hundred steeples. The acclamations of an immense
      multitude were heard from time to time, like the roaring of a mighty
      ocean, and all this without my being able to glean the least idea of what
      was going on, for the windows of our apartment looked upon a waste
      backyard, which seemed totally deserted. My curiosity became extreme, for
      I was satisfied, at length, that it must be some festival of the highest
      order which called forth these incessant sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My uncle at length returned, and with him a man of an exterior singularly
      unprepossessing. I need not describe him to you, for&mdash;do not look
      round&mdash;he rides behind us at this moment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That respectable person, Mr. Cristal Nixon, I suppose?&rsquo; said Darsie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The same,&rsquo; answered Lilias; &lsquo;make no gesture, that may intimate we are
      speaking of him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Darsie signified that he understood her, and she pursued her relation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They were both in full dress, and my uncle, taking a bundle from Nixon,
      said to me, &ldquo;Lilias, I am come to carry you to see a grand ceremony&mdash;put
      on as hastily as you can the dress you will find in that parcel, and
      prepare to attend me.&rdquo; I found a female dress, splendid and elegant, but
      somewhat bordering upon the antique fashion. It might be that of England,
      I thought, and I went to my apartment full of curiosity, and dressed
      myself with all speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My uncle surveyed me with attention&mdash;&ldquo;She may pass for one of the
      flower-girls,&rdquo; he said to Nixon, who only answered with a nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We left the house together, and such was their knowledge of the lanes,
      courts, and bypaths, that though there was the roar of a multitude in the
      broad streets, those which we traversed were silent and deserted; and the
      strollers whom we met, tired of gazing upon gayer figures, scarcely
      honoured us with a passing look, although, at any other time, we should,
      among these vulgar suburbs, have attracted a troublesome share of
      observation. We crossed at length a broad street, where many soldiers were
      on guard, while others, exhausted with previous duty, were eating,
      drinking, smoking, and sleeping beside their piled arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;One day, Nixon,&rdquo; whispered my uncle, &ldquo;we will make these redcoated
      gentry stand to their muskets more watchfully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Or it will be the worse for them,&rdquo; answered his attendant, in a voice as
      unpleasant as his physiognomy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Unquestioned and unchallenged by any one, we crossed among the guards;
      and Nixon tapped thrice at a small postern door in a huge ancient
      building, which was straight before us. It opened, and we entered without
      my perceiving by whom we were admitted. A few dark and narrow passages at
      length conveyed us into an immense Gothic hall, the magnificence of which
      baffles my powers of description.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was illuminated by ten thousand wax lights, whose splendour at first
      dazzled my eyes, coming as we did from these dark and secret avenues. But
      when my sight began to become steady, how shall I describe what I beheld?
      Beneath were huge ranges of tables, occupied by princes and nobles in
      their robes of state&mdash;high officers of the crown, wearing their
      dresses and badges of authority&mdash;reverend prelates and judges, the
      sages of the church and law, in their more sombre, yet not less awful
      robes&mdash;with others whose antique and striking costume announced their
      importance, though I could not even guess who they might be. But at length
      the truth burst on me at once&mdash;it was, and the murmurs around
      confirmed it, the Coronation Feast. At a table above the rest, and
      extending across the upper end of the hall, sat enthroned the youthful
      sovereign himself, surrounded by the princes of the blood, and other
      dignitaries, and receiving the suit and homage of his subjects. Heralds
      and pursuivants, blazing in their fantastic yet splendid armorial habits,
      and pages of honour, gorgeously arrayed in the garb of other days, waited
      upon the princely banqueters. In the galleries with which this spacious
      hall was surrounded, shone all, and more than all, that my poor
      imagination could conceive, of what was brilliant in riches, or
      captivating in beauty. Countless rows of ladies, whose diamonds, jewels,
      and splendid attire were their least powerful charms, looked down from
      their lofty seats on the rich scene beneath, themselves forming a show as
      dazzling and as beautiful as that of which they were spectators. Under
      these galleries, and behind the banqueting tables, were a multitude of
      gentlemen, dressed as if to attend a court, but whose garb, although rich
      enough to have adorned a royal drawing room, could not distinguish them in
      such a high scene as this. Amongst these we wandered for a few minutes,
      undistinguished and unregarded. I saw several young persons dressed as I
      was, so was under no embarrassment from the singularity of my habit, and
      only rejoiced, as I hung on my uncle&rsquo;s arm, at the magical splendour of
      such a scene, and at his goodness for procuring me the pleasure of
      beholding it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By and by, I perceived that my uncle had acquaintances among those who
      were under the galleries, and seemed, like ourselves, to be mere
      spectators of the solemnity. They recognized each other with a single
      word, sometimes only with a grip of the hand-exchanged some private signs,
      doubtless&mdash;and gradually formed a little group, in the centre of
      which we were placed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Is it not a grand sight, Lilias?&rdquo; said my uncle. &ldquo;All the noble, and all
      the wise, and all the wealthy of Britain, are there assembled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;It is indeed,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;all that my mind could have fancied of regal
      power and splendour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Girl,&rdquo; he whispered,&mdash;and my uncle can make his whispers as
      terribly emphatic as his thundering voice or his blighting look&mdash;&ldquo;all
      that is noble and worthy in this fair land are there assembled&mdash;but
      it is to bend like slaves and sycophants before the throne of a new
      usurper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I looked at him, and the dark hereditary frown of our unhappy ancestor
      was black upon his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; I whispered, &ldquo;consider where we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Fear nothing,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;we are surrounded by friends.&rdquo; As he proceeded,
      his strong and muscular frame shook with suppressed agitation. &ldquo;See,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;yonder bends Norfolk, renegade to his Catholic.faith; there stoops
      the Bishop of &mdash;&mdash;, traitor to the Church of England; and,&mdash;shame
      of shames! yonder the gigantic form of Errol bows his head before the
      grandson of his father&rsquo;s murderer! But a sign shall be seen this night
      amongst them&mdash;MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN, shall be read on these
      walls, as distinctly as the spectral handwriting made them visible on
      those of Belshazzar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; said I, dreadfully alarmed, &ldquo;it is impossible you can
      meditate violence in such a presence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;None is intended, fool,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;nor can the slightest mischance
      happen, provided you will rally your boasted courage, and obey my
      directions. But do it coolly and quickly, for there are a hundred lives at
      stake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Alas! what&mdash;can I do?&rdquo; I asked in the utmost terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Only be prompt to execute my bidding,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;it is but to lift a
      glove&mdash;Here, hold this in your hand&mdash;throw the train of your
      dress over it, be firm, composed, and ready&mdash;or, at all events, I
      step forward myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;If there is no violence designed,&rdquo; I said, taking, mechanically, the
      iron glove he put into my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I could not conceive his meaning; but, in the excited state of mind in
      which I beheld him, I was convinced that disobedience on my part would
      lead to some wild explosion. I felt, from the emergency of the occasion, a
      sudden presence of mind, and resolved to do anything that might avert
      violence and bloodshed. I was not long held in suspense. A loud flourish
      of trumpets and the voice of heralds were mixed with the clatter of
      horses&rsquo; hoofs, while a champion, armed at all points like those I had read
      of in romances, attended by squires, pages, and the whole retinue of
      chivalry, pranced forward, mounted upon a barbed steed. His challenge, in
      defiance of all who dared impeach the title of the new sovereign, was
      recited aloud&mdash;once, and again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Rush in at the third sounding,&rdquo; said my uncle to me; &ldquo;bring me the
      parader&rsquo;s gage, and leave mine in lieu of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could not see how this was to be done, as we were surrounded by people
      on all sides. But, at the third sounding of the trumpets, a lane opened as
      if by word of command, betwixt me and the champion, and my uncle&rsquo;s voice
      said, &ldquo;Now, Lilias, NOW!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With a swift and yet steady step, and with a presence of mind for which I
      have never since been able to account, I discharged the perilous
      commission. I was hardly seen, I believe, as I exchanged the pledges of
      battle, and in an instant retired. &ldquo;Nobly done, my girl!&rdquo; said my uncle,
      at whose side I found myself, shrouded as I was before, by the
      interposition of the bystanders. &ldquo;Cover our retreat, gentlemen,&rdquo; he
      whispered to those around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Room was made for us to approach the wall, which seemed to open, and we
      were again involved in the dark passages through which we had formerly
      passed. In a small anteroom, my uncle stopped, and hastily muffling me in
      a mantle which was lying there, we passed the guards&mdash;threaded the
      labyrinth of empty streets and courts, and reached our retired lodgings
      without attracting the least attention.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have often heard,&rsquo; said Darsie, &lsquo;that a female, supposed to be a man in
      disguise,&mdash;and yet, Lilias, you do not look very masculine,&mdash;had
      taken up the champion&rsquo;s gauntlet at the present king&rsquo;s coronation, and
      left in its place a gage of battle, with a paper, offering to accept the
      combat, provided a fair field should be allowed for it. I have hitherto
      considered it as an idle tale. I little thought how nearly I was
      interested in the actors of a scene so daring. How could you have courage
      to go through with it?&rsquo; [See Note 9.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Had I had leisure for reflection,&rsquo; answered his sister, &lsquo;I should have
      refused, from a mixture of principle and of fear. But, like many people
      who do daring actions, I went on because I had not time to think of
      retreating. The matter was little known, and it is said the king had
      commanded that it should not be further inquired into;&mdash;from
      prudence, as I suppose, and lenity, though my uncle chooses to ascribe the
      forbearance of the Elector of Hanover, as he calls him, sometimes to
      pusillanimity, and sometimes to a presumptuous scorn of the faction who
      opposes his title.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And have your subsequent agencies under this frantic enthusiast,&rsquo; said
      Darsie, &lsquo;equalled this in danger?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No&mdash;nor in importance,&rsquo; replied Lilias; &lsquo;though I have witnessed
      much of the strange and desperate machinations, by which, in spite of
      every obstacle, and in contempt of every danger, he endeavours to awaken
      the courage of a broken party. I have traversed, in his company, all
      England and Scotland, and have visited the most extraordinary and
      contrasted scenes; now lodging at the castles of the proud gentry of
      Cheshire and Wales, where the retired aristocrats, with opinions as
      antiquated as their dwellings and their manners, still continue to nourish
      Jacobitical principles; and the next week, perhaps, spent among outlawed
      smugglers, or Highland banditti. I have known my uncle often act the part
      of a hero, and sometimes that of a mere vulgar conspirator, and turn
      himself, with the most surprising flexibility, into all sorts of shapes to
      attract proselytes to his cause.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which, in the present day,&rsquo; said Darsie, &lsquo;he finds, I presume, no easy
      task.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So difficult,&rsquo; said Lilias, &lsquo;that, I believe, he has, at different times,
      disgusted with the total falling away of some friends, and the coldness of
      others, been almost on the point of resigning his undertaking. How often I
      have I known him affect an open brow and a jovial manner, joining in the
      games of the gentry, and even in the sports of the common people, in order
      to invest himself with a temporary degree of popularity; while, in fact,
      his heart was bursting to witness what he called the degeneracy of the
      times, the decay of activity among the aged, and the want of zeal in the
      rising generation. After the day has been spent in the hardest exercise,
      he has spent the night in pacing his solitary chamber, bewailing the
      downfall of the cause, and wishing for the bullet of Dundee or the axe of
      Balmerino.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A strange delusion,&rsquo; said Darsie; &lsquo;and it is wonderful that it does not
      yield to the force of reality.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, but,&rsquo; replied Lilias, &lsquo;realities of late have seemed to flatter his
      hopes. The general dissatisfaction with the peace&mdash;the unpopularity
      of the minister, which has extended itself even to the person of his
      master&mdash;the various uproars which have disturbed the peace of the
      metropolis, and a general state of disgust and disaffection, which seems
      to affect the body of the nation, have given unwonted encouragement to the
      expiring hopes of the Jacobites, and induced many, both at the Court of
      Rome, and, if it can be called so, of the Pretender, to lend a more
      favourable ear than they had hitherto done to the insinuations of those
      who, like my uncle, hope, when hope is lost to all but themselves. Nay, I
      really believe that at this moment they meditate some desperate effort. My
      uncle has been doing all in his power, of late, to conciliate the
      affections of those wild communities that dwell on the Solway, over whom
      our family possessed a seignorial interest before the forfeiture, and
      amongst whom, on the occasion of 1745, our unhappy father&rsquo;s interest, with
      his own, raised a considerable body of men. But they are no longer willing
      to obey his summons; and, as one apology among others, they allege your
      absence as their natural head and leader. This has increased his desire to
      obtain possession of your person, and, if he possibly can, to influence
      your mind, so as to obtain your authority to his proceedings.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That he shall never obtain,&rsquo; answered Darsie; &lsquo;my principles and my
      prudence alike forbid such a step. Besides, it would be totally unavailing
      to his purpose. Whatever these people may pretend, to evade your uncle&rsquo;s
      importunities, they cannot, at this time of day, think of subjecting their
      necks again to the feudal yoke, which was effectually broken by the act of
      1748, abolishing vassalage and hereditary jurisdictions.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, but that my uncle considers as the act of a usurping government,&rsquo; 
      said Lilias.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Like enough he may think so,&rsquo; answered her brother, &lsquo;for he is a
      superior, and loses his authority by, the enactment. But the question is,
      what the vassals will think of it who have gained their freedom from
      feudal slavery, and have now enjoyed that freedom for many years? However,
      to cut the matter short, if five hundred men would rise at the wagging of
      my finger, that finger shall not be raised in a cause which I disapprove
      of, and upon that my uncle may reckon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you may temporize,&rsquo; said Lilias, upon whom the idea of her uncle&rsquo;s
      displeasure made evidently a strong impression,&mdash;&lsquo;you may temporize,
      as most of the gentry in this country do, and let the bubble burst of
      itself; for it is singular how few of them venture to oppose my uncle
      directly. I entreat you to avoid direct collision with him. To hear you,
      the head of the House of Redgauntlet, declare against the family of
      Stuart, would either break his heart, or drive him to some act of
      desperation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, but, Lilias, you forget that the consequences of such an act of
      complaisance might be, that the House of Redgauntlet and I might lose both
      our heads at one blow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;I had forgotten that danger. I have grown familiar with
      perilous intrigues, as the nurses in a pest-house are said to become
      accustomed to the air around them, till they forget even that it is
      noisome.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And yet,&rsquo; said Darsie, &lsquo;if I could free myself from him without coming to
      an open rupture. Tell me, Lilias, do you think it possible that he can
      have any immediate attempt in view?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To confess the truth,&rsquo; answered Lilias, &lsquo;I cannot doubt that he has.
      There has been an unusual bustle among the Jacobites of late. They have
      hopes, as I told you, from circumstances unconnected with their own
      strength. Just before you came to the country, my uncle&rsquo;s desire to find
      you out became, if possible, more eager than ever&mdash;he talked of men
      to be presently brought together, and of your name and influence for
      raising them. At this very time your first visit to Brokenburn took place.
      A suspicion arose in my uncle&rsquo;s mind, that you might be the youth he
      sought, and it was strengthened by papers and letters which the rascal
      Nixon did not hesitate to take from your pocket. Yet a mistake might have
      occasioned a fatal explosion; and my uncle therefore posted to Edinburgh
      to follow out the clue he had obtained, and fished enough of information
      from old Mr. Fairford to make him certain that you were the person he
      sought. Meanwhile, and at the expense of some personal and perhaps too
      bold exertion, I endeavoured, through your friend young Fairford, to put
      you on your guard.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Without success,&rsquo; said Darsie, blushing under his mask when he
      recollected how he had mistaken his sister&rsquo;s meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not wonder that my warning was fruitless,&rsquo; said she; &lsquo;the thing was
      doomed to be. Besides, your escape would have been difficult. You were
      dogged the whole time you were at the Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush and at Mount Sharon,
      by a spy who scarcely ever left you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The wretch, little Benjie!&rsquo; exclaimed Darsie. &lsquo;I will wring the monkey&rsquo;s
      neck round, the first time we meet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was he indeed who gave constant information of your motions to Cristal
      Nixon,&rsquo; said Lilias.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Cristal Nixon&mdash;I owe him, too, a day&rsquo;s work in harvest,&rsquo; said
      Darsie; &lsquo;for I am mistaken if he was not the person that struck me down
      when I was made prisoner among the rioters.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Like enough; for he has a head and hand for any villany. My uncle was
      very angry about it; for though the riot was made to have an opportunity
      of carrying you off in the confusion, as well as to put the fishermen at
      variance with the public law, it would have been his last thought to have
      injured a hair of your head. But Nixon has insinuated himself into all my
      uncle&rsquo;s secrets, and some of these are so dark and dangerous, that though
      there are few things he would not dare, I doubt if he dare quarrel with
      him. And yet I know that of Cristal would move my uncle to pass his sword
      through his body.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake?&rsquo;, said Darsie. &lsquo;I have a particular desire
      for wishing to know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The old, brutal desperado, whose face and mind are a libel upon human
      nature, has had the insolence to speak to his master&rsquo;s niece as one whom
      he was at liberty to admire; and when I turned on him with the anger and
      contempt he merited, the wretch grumbled out something, as if he held the
      destiny of our family in his hand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thank you, Lilias,&rsquo; said Darsie, eagerly,&mdash;&lsquo;I thank you with all
      my heart for this communication. I have blamed myself as a Christian man
      for the indescribable longing I felt from the first moment I saw that
      rascal, to send a bullet through his head; and now you have perfectly
      accounted for and justified this very laudable wish. I wonder my uncle,
      with the powerful sense you describe him to be possessed of, does not see
      through such a villain.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe he knows him to be capable of much evil,&rsquo; answered Lilias&mdash;&lsquo;selfish,
      obdurate, brutal, and a man-hater. But then he conceives him to possess
      the qualities most requisite for a conspirator&mdash;undaunted courage,
      imperturbable coolness and address, and inviolable fidelity. In the last
      particular he may be mistaken. I have heard Nixon blamed for the manner in
      which our poor father was taken after Culloden.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Another reason for my innate aversion,&rsquo; said Darsie, but I will be on my
      guard with him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;See, he observes us closely,&rsquo; said Lilias. &lsquo;What a thing is conscience!
      He knows we are now speaking of him, though he cannot have heard a word
      that we have said.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed as if she had guessed truly; for Cristal Nixon at that moment
      rode up to them, and said, with an affectation of jocularity, which sat
      very ill on his sullen features, &lsquo;Come, young ladies, you have had time
      enough for your chat this morning, and your tongues, I think, must be
      tired. We are going to pass a village, and I must beg you to separate&mdash;you,
      Miss Lilias, to ride a little behind&mdash;and you, Mrs., or Miss, or
      Master, whichever you choose to be called, to be jogging a little before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lilias checked her horse without speaking, but not until she had given her
      brother an expressive look, recommending caution; to which he replied by a
      signal indicating that he understood and would comply with her request.

      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      NARRATTVE OF DARSIE LATIMER, CONTINUED
    </h3>
    <p>
      Left to his solitary meditations, Darsie (for we will still term Sir
      Arthur Darsie Redgauntlet of that Ilk by the name to which the reader is
      habituated) was surprised not only at the alteration of his own state and
      condition, but at the equanimity with which he felt himself disposed to
      view all these vicissitudes.
    </p>
    <p>
      His fever&mdash;fit of love had departed like a morning&rsquo;s dream, and left
      nothing behind but a painful sense of shame, and a resolution to be more
      cautious ere he again indulged in such romantic visions. His station in
      society was changed from that of a wandering, unowned youth, in whom none
      appeared to take an interest excepting the strangers by whom he had been
      educated, to the heir of a noble house, possessed of such influence and
      such property, that it seemed as if the progress or arrest of important
      political events were likely to depend upon his resolution. Even this
      sudden elevation, the more than fulfilment of those wishes which had
      haunted him ever since he was able to form a wish on the subject, was
      contemplated by Darsie, volatile as his disposition was, without more than
      a few thrills of gratified vanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true, there were circumstances in his present situation to
      counterbalance such high advantages. To be a prisoner in the hands of a
      man so determined as his uncle, was no agreeable consideration, when he
      was calculating how he might best dispute his pleasure and refuse to join
      him in the perilous enterprise which he seemed to meditate. Outlawed and
      desperate himself, Darsie could not doubt that his uncle was surrounded by
      men capable of anything&mdash;that he was restrained by no personal
      considerations&mdash;and therefore what degree of compulsion he might
      apply to his brother&rsquo;s son, or in what manner he might feel at liberty to
      punish his contumacy, should he disavow the Jacobite cause, must depend
      entirely upon the limits of his own conscience; and who was to answer for
      the conscience of a heated enthusiast who considers opposition to the
      party he has espoused, as treason to the welfare of his country? After a
      short interval, Cristal Nixon was pleased to throw some light upon the
      subject which agitated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When that grim satellite rode up without ceremony close to Darsie&rsquo;s side,
      the latter felt his very flesh creep with abhorrence, so little was he
      able to endure his presence, since the story of Lilias had added to his
      instinctive hatred of the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice, too, sounded like that of a screech-owl, as he said, &lsquo;So, my
      young cock of the north, you now know it all, and no doubt are blessing
      your uncle for stirring you up to such an honourable action.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will acquaint my uncle with my sentiments on the subject, before I make
      them known to any one else,&rsquo; said Darsie, scarcely prevailing on his
      tongue to utter even these few words in a civil manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Umph,&rsquo; murmured Cristal betwixt his teeth. &lsquo;Close as wax, I see; and
      perhaps not quite so pliable. But take care, my pretty youth,&rsquo; he added,
      scornfully; &lsquo;Hugh Redgauntlet will prove a rough colt-breaker&mdash;he
      will neither spare whipcord nor spur-rowel, I promise you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have already said, Mr. Nixon, answered Darsie, &lsquo;that I will canvass
      those matters of which my sister has informed me, with my uncle himself,
      and with no other person.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, but a word of friendly advice would do you no harm, young master,&rsquo; 
      replied Nixon. &lsquo;Old Redgauntlet is apter at a blow than a word&mdash;likely
      to bite before he barks&mdash;the true man for giving Scarborough warning,
      first knock you down, then bid you stand. So, methinks, a little kind
      warning as to consequences were not amiss, lest they come upon you
      unawares.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If the warning is really kind, Mr. Nixon,&rsquo; said the young man, &lsquo;I will
      hear it thankfully; and indeed, if otherwise, I must listen to it whether
      I will or no, since I have at present no choice of company or of
      conversation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, I have but little to say,&rsquo; said Nixon, affecting to give to his
      sullen and dogged manner the appearance of an honest bluntness; &lsquo;I am as
      little apt to throw away words as any one. But here is the question&mdash;Will
      you join heart and hand with your uncle, or no?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What if I should say Aye?&rsquo; said Darsie, determined, if possible, to
      conceal his resolution from this man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, then,&rsquo; said Nixon, somewhat surprised at the readiness of his
      answer, &lsquo;all will go smooth, of course&mdash;you will take share in this
      noble undertaking, and, when it succeeds, you will exchange your open
      helmet for an earl&rsquo;s coronet perhaps.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how if it fails?&rsquo; said Darsie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thereafter as it may be,&rsquo; said Nixon; &lsquo;they who play at bowls must meet
      with rubbers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, but suppose, then, I have some foolish tenderness for my windpipe,
      and that when my uncle proposes the adventure to me I should say No&mdash;how
      then, Mr. Nixon?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, then, I would have you look to yourself, young master. There are
      sharp laws in France against refractory pupils&mdash;LETTRES DE CACHET are
      easily come by when such men as we are concerned with interest themselves
      in the matter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But we are not in France,&rsquo; said poor Darsie, through whose blood ran a
      cold shivering at the idea of a French prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A fast-sailing lugger will soon bring you there though, snug stowed under
      hatches, like a cask of moonlight.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But the French are at peace with us,&rsquo; said Darsie, &lsquo;and would not dare&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, who would ever hear of you?&rsquo; interrupted Nixon; &lsquo;do you imagine that
      a foreign court would call you up for judgement, and put the sentence of
      imprisonment in the COURRIER DE L&rsquo;EUROPE, as they do at the Old Bailey?
      No, no, young gentleman&mdash;the gates of the Bastille, and of Mont Saint
      Michel, and the Castle of Vincennes, move on d&mdash;d easy hinges when
      they let folk in&mdash;not the least jar is heard. There are cool cells
      there for hot heads&mdash;as calm, and quiet, and dark, as you could wish
      in Bedlam&mdash;and the dismissal comes when the carpenter brings the
      prisoner&rsquo;s coffin, and not sooner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Mr. Nixon,&rsquo; said Darsie, affecting a cheerfulness which he was far
      from feeling, &lsquo;mine is a hard case&mdash;a sort of hanging choice, you
      will allow&mdash;since I must either offend our own government here and
      run the risk of my life for doing so, or be doomed to the dungeons of
      another country, whose laws I have never offended since I have never trod
      its soil&mdash;Tell me what you would do if you were in my place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you that when I am there,&rsquo; said Nixon, and, checking his horse,
      fell back to the rear of the little party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is evident,&rsquo; thought the young man, &lsquo;that the villain believes me
      completely noosed, and perhaps has the ineffable impudence to suppose that
      my sister must eventually succeed to the possessions which have occasioned
      my loss of freedom, and that his own influence over the destinies of our
      unhappy family may secure him possession of the heiress; but he shall
      perish by my hand first!&mdash;I must now be on the alert to make my
      escape, if possible, before I am forced on shipboard. Blind Willie will
      not, I think, desert me without an effort on my behalf, especially if he
      has learned that I am the son of his late unhappy patron. What a change is
      mine! Whilst I possessed neither rank nor fortune, I lived safely and
      unknown, under the protection of the kind and respectable friends whose
      hearts Heaven had moved towards me. Now that I am the head of an
      honourable house, and that enterprises of the most daring character await
      my decision, and retainers and vassals seem ready to rise at my beck, my
      safety consists chiefly in the attachment of a blind stroller!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was revolving these things in his mind, and preparing himself for
      the interview with his uncle which could not but be a stormy one, he saw
      Hugh Redgauntlet come riding slowly back to meet them without any
      attendants. Cristal Nixon rode up as he approached, and, as they met,
      fixed on him a look of inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The fool, Crackenthorp,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet, has let strangers into his
      house. Some of his smuggling comrades, I believe; we must ride slowly to
      give him time to send them packing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you see any of your friends?&rsquo; said Cristal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Three, and have letters from many more. They are unanimous on the subject
      you wot of&mdash;and the point must be conceded to them, or, far as the
      matter has gone, it will go no further.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will hardly bring the father to stoop to his flock,&rsquo; said Cristal,
      with a sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He must and shall!&rsquo; answered Redgauntlet, briefly. &lsquo;Go to the front,
      Cristal&mdash;I would speak with my nephew. I trust, Sir Arthur
      Redgauntlet, you are satisfied with the manner in which I have discharged
      my duty to your sister?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There can be no fault found to her manners or sentiments,&rsquo; answered
      Darsie; &lsquo;I am happy in knowing a relative so amiable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am glad of it,&rsquo; answered Mr. Redgauntlet. &lsquo;I am no nice judge of
      women&rsquo;s qualifications, and my life has been dedicated to one great
      object; so that since she left France she has had but little opportunity
      of improvement. I have subjected her, however, as little as possible to
      the inconveniences and privations of my wandering and dangerous life. From
      time to time she has resided for weeks and months with families of honour
      and respectability, and I am glad that she has, in, your opinion, the
      manners and behaviour which become her birth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Darsie expressed himself perfectly satisfied, and there was a little
      pause, which Redgauntlet broke by solemnly addressing his nephew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For you, my nephew, I also hoped to have done much. The weakness and
      timidity of your mother sequestered you from my care, or it would have
      been my pride and happiness to have trained up the son of my unhappy
      brother in those paths of honour in which our ancestors have always trod.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now comes the storm,&rsquo; thought Darsie to himself, and began to collect his
      thoughts, as the cautious master of a vessel furls his sails and makes his
      ship snug when he discerns the approaching squall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My mother&rsquo;s conduct in respect to me might be misjudged,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;but
      it was founded on the most anxious affection.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Assuredly,&rsquo; said his uncle, &lsquo;and I have no wish to reflect on her memory,
      though her mistrust has done so much injury, I will not say to me, but to
      the cause of my unhappy country. Her scheme was, I think, to have made you
      that wretched pettifogging being, which they still continue to call in
      derision by the once respectable name of a Scottish Advocate; one of those
      mongrel things that must creep to learn the ultimate decision of his
      causes to the bar of a foreign court, instead of pleading before the
      independent and august Parliament of his own native kingdom.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did prosecute the study of law for a year or two, said Darsie, &lsquo;but I
      found I had neither taste nor talents for the science.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And left it with scorn, doubtless,&rsquo; said Mr. Redgauntlet. &lsquo;Well, I now
      hold up to you, my dearest nephew, a more worthy object of ambition. Look
      eastward&mdash;do you see a monument standing on yonder plain, near a
      hamlet?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Darsie replied that he did,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The hamlet is called Burgh-upon-Sands, and yonder monument is erected to
      the memory of the tyrant Edward I. The just hand of Providence overtook
      him on that spot, as he was leading his bands to complete the subjugation
      of Scotland whose civil dissensions began under his accursed policy. The
      glorious career of Bruce might have been stopped in its outset; the field
      of Bannockburn might have remained a bloodless turf, if God had not
      removed, in the very crisis, the crafty and bold tyrant who had so long
      been Scotland&rsquo;s scourge. Edward&rsquo;s grave is the cradle of our national
      freedom. It is within sight of that great landmark of our liberty that I
      have to propose to you an undertaking, second in honour and importance to
      none since the immortal Bruce stabbed the Red Comyn, and grasped with his
      yet bloody hand the independent crown of Scotland.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused for an answer; but Darsie, overawed by the energy of his manner,
      and unwilling to commit himself by a hasty explanation, remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will not suppose,&rsquo; said Hugh Redgauntlet, after a pause, that you are
      either so dull as not to comprehend the import of my words&mdash;or so
      dastardly as to be dismayed by my proposal&mdash;or so utterly degenerate
      from the blood and sentiments of your ancestors, as not to feel my summons
      as the horse hears the war-trumpet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will not pretend to misunderstand you, sir,&rsquo; said Darsie; &lsquo;but an
      enterprise directed against a dynasty now established for three reigns
      requires strong arguments, both in point of justice and of expediency, to
      recommend it to men of conscience and prudence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will not,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet, while his eyes sparkled with anger,&mdash;&lsquo;I
      will not hear you speak a word against the justice of that enterprise, for
      which your oppressed country calls with the voice of a parent, entreating
      her children for aid&mdash;or against that noble revenge which your
      father&rsquo;s blood demands from his dishonoured grave. His skull is yet
      standing over the Rikargate, [The northern gate of Carlisle was long
      garnished with the heads of the Scottish rebels executed in 1746.] and
      even its bleak and mouldered jaws command you to be a man. I ask you, in
      the name of God and of your country, will you draw your sword and go with
      me to Carlisle, were it but to lay your father&rsquo;s head, now the perch of
      the obscene owl and carrion crow and the scoff of every ribald clown, in
      consecrated earth as befits his long ancestry?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Darsie, unprepared to answer an appeal urged with so much passion, and not
      doubting a direct refusal would cost him his liberty or life, was again
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see,&rsquo; said his uncle, in a more composed tone, &lsquo;that it is not
      deficiency of spirit, but the grovelling habits of a confined education,
      among the poor-spirited class you were condemned to herd with, that keeps
      you silent. You scarce yet believe yourself a Redgauntlet; your pulse has
      not yet learned the genuine throb that answers to the summons of honour
      and of patriotism.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I trust,&rsquo; replied Darsie, at last, &lsquo;that I shall never be found
      indifferent to the call of either; but to answer them with effect&mdash;even
      were I convinced that they now sounded in my ear&mdash;I must see some
      reasonable hope of success in the desperate enterprise in which you would
      involve me. I look around me, and I see a settled government&mdash;an
      established authority&mdash;a born Briton on the throne&mdash;the very
      Highland mountaineers, upon whom alone the trust of the exiled family
      reposed, assembled into regiments which act under the orders of the
      existing dynasty. [The Highland regiments were first employed by the
      celebrated Earl of Chatham, who assumed to himself no small degree of
      praise for having called forth to the support of the country and the
      government, the valour which had been too often directed against both.]
      France has been utterly dismayed by the tremendous lessons of the last
      war, and will hardly provoke another. All without and within the kingdom
      is adverse to encountering a hopeless struggle, and you alone, sir, seem
      willing to undertake a desperate enterprise.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And would undertake it were it ten times more desperate; and have
      agitated it when ten times the obstacles were interposed. Have I forgot my
      brother&rsquo;s blood? Can I&mdash;dare I even now repeat the Pater Noster,
      since my enemies and the murderers remain unforgiven? Is there an art I
      have not practised&mdash;a privation to which I have not submitted, to
      bring on the crisis, which I now behold arrived? Have I not been a vowed
      and a devoted man, forgoing every comfort of social life, renouncing even
      the exercise of devotion unless when I might name in prayer my prince and
      country, submitting to everything to make converts to this noble cause?
      Have I done all this, and shall I now stop short?&rsquo; Darsie was about to
      interrupt him, but he pressed his hand affectionately upon his shoulder,
      and enjoining, or rather imploring, silence, &lsquo;Peace,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;heir of my
      ancestors&rsquo; fame&mdash;heir of all my hopes and wishes. Peace, son of my
      slaughtered brother! I have sought for thee, and mourned for thee, as a
      mother for an only child. Do not let me again lose you in the moment when
      you are restored to my hopes. Believe me, I distrust so much my own
      impatient temper, that I entreat you, as the dearest boon, do naught to
      awaken it at this crisis.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Darsie was not sorry to reply that his respect for the person of his
      relation would induce him to listen to all which he had to apprise him of,
      before he formed any definite resolution upon the weighty subjects of
      deliberation which he proposed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Deliberation!&rsquo; repeated Redgauntlet, impatiently; &lsquo;and yet it is not ill
      said. I wish there had been more warmth in thy reply, Arthur; but I must
      recollect, were an eagle bred in a falcon&rsquo;s mew and hooded like a
      reclaimed hawk, he could not at first gaze steadily on the sun. Listen to
      me, my dearest Arthur. The state of this nation no more implies
      prosperity, than the florid colour of a feverish patient is a symptom of
      health. All is false and hollow. The apparent success of Chatham&rsquo;s
      administration has plunged the country deeper in debt than all the barren
      acres of Canada are worth, were they as fertile as Yorkshire&mdash;the
      dazzling lustre of the victories of Minden and Quebec have been dimmed by
      the disgrace of the hasty peace&mdash;by the war, England, at immense
      expense, gained nothing but honour, and that she has gratuitously
      resigned. Many eyes, formerly cold and indifferent, are now looking
      towards the line of our ancient and rightful monarchs, as the only refuge
      in the approaching storm&mdash;the rich are alarmed&mdash;the nobles are
      disgusted&mdash;the populace are inflamed&mdash;and a band of patriots,
      whose measures are more safe than their numbers are few, have resolved to
      set up King Charles&rsquo;s standard.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But the military,&rsquo; said Darsie&mdash;&lsquo;how can you, with a body of unarmed
      and disorderly insurgents, propose to encounter a regular army. The
      Highlanders are now totally disarmed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In a great measure, perhaps,&rsquo; answered Redgauntlet; &lsquo;but the policy which
      raised the Highland regiments has provided for that. We have already
      friends in these corps; nor can we doubt for a moment what their conduct
      will be when the white cockade is once more mounted. The rest of the
      standing army has been greatly reduced since the peace; and we reckon
      confidently on our standard being joined by thousands of the disbanded
      troops.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; said Darsie, &lsquo;and is it upon such vague hopes as these, the
      inconstant humour of a crowd or of a disbanded soldiery, that men of
      honour are invited to risk their families, their property, their life?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Men of honour, boy,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet, his eyes glancing with impatience,
      &lsquo;set life, property, family, and all at stake, when that honour commands
      it! We are not now weaker than when seven men, landing in the wilds of
      Moidart, shook the throne of the usurper till it tottered&mdash;won two
      pitched fields, besides overrunning one kingdom and the half of another,
      and, but for treachery, would have achieved what their venturous
      successors are now to attempt in their turn.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And will such an attempt be made in serious earnest?&rsquo; said Darsie.
      &lsquo;Excuse me, my uncle, if I can scarce believe a fact so extraordinary.
      Will there really be found men of rank and consequence sufficient to renew
      the adventure of 1745?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will not give you my confidence by halves, Sir Arthur,&rsquo; replied his
      uncle&mdash;&lsquo;Look at that scroll&mdash;what say you to these names?&mdash;Are
      they not the flower of the western shires&mdash;of Wales of Scotland?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The paper contains indeed the names of many that are great and noble,&rsquo; 
      replied Darsie, after perusing it; &lsquo;but&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what?&rsquo; asked his uncle, impatiently; &lsquo;do you doubt the ability of
      those nobles and gentlemen to furnish the aid in men and money at which
      they are rated?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not their ability certainly,&rsquo; said Darsie, &lsquo;for of that I am no competent
      judge; but I see in this scroll the name of Sir Arthur Darsie Redgauntlet
      of that Ilk, rated at a hundred men and upwards&mdash;I certainly am
      ignorant how he is to redeem that pledge.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will be responsible for the men,&rsquo; replied Hugh Redgauntlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, my dear uncle,&rsquo; added Darsie, &lsquo;I hope for your sake that the other
      individuals whose names are here written, have had more acquaintance with
      your plan than I have been indulged with.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For thee and thine I can be myself responsible,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet; &lsquo;for
      if thou hast not the courage to head the force of thy house, the leading
      shall pass to other hands, and thy inheritance shall depart from thee like
      vigour and verdure from a rotten branch. For these honourable persons, a
      slight condition there is which they annex to their friendship&mdash;something
      so trifling that it is scarce worthy of mention. This boon granted to them
      by him who is most interested, there is no question they will take the
      field in the manner there stated.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Darsie perused the paper, and felt himself still less inclined to
      believe that so many men of family and fortune were likely to embark in an
      enterprise so fatal. It seemed as if some rash plotter had put down at a
      venture the names of all whom common report tainted with Jacobitism; or if
      it was really the act of the individuals named, he suspected that they
      must be aware of some mode of excusing themselves from compliance with its
      purport. It was impossible, he thought, that Englishmen, of large fortune,
      who had failed to join Charles when he broke into England at the head of a
      victorious army, should have the least thoughts of encouraging a descent
      when circumstances were so much less propitious. He therefore concluded
      the enterprise would fall to pieces of itself, and that his best way was,
      in the meantime, to remain silent, unless the actual approach of a crisis
      (which might, however, never arrive) should compel him to give a downright
      refusal to his uncle&rsquo;s proposition; and if, in the interim, some door for
      escape should be opened, he resolved within himself not to omit availing
      himself of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh Redgauntlet watched his nephew&rsquo;s looks for some time, and then, as if
      arriving from some other process of reasoning at the same conclusion, he
      said, &lsquo;I have told you, Sir Arthur, that I do not urge your immediate
      accession to my proposal; indeed the consequences of a refusal would be so
      dreadful to yourself, so destructive to all the hopes which I have nursed,
      that I would not risk, by a moment&rsquo;s impatience, the object of my whole
      life. Yes, Arthur, I have been a self-denying hermit at one time&mdash;at
      another, the apparent associate of outlaws and desperadoes&mdash;at
      another, the subordinate agent of men whom I felt in every way my
      inferiors&mdash;not for any selfish purpose of my own, no, not even to win
      for myself the renown of being the principal instrument in restoring my
      king and freeing my country. My first wish on earth is for that
      restoration and that freedom&mdash;my next, that my nephew, the
      representative of my house and of the brother of my love, may have the
      advantage and the credit of all my efforts in the good cause. But,&rsquo; he
      added, darting on Darsie one of his withering frowns, &lsquo;if Scotland and my
      father&rsquo;s house cannot stand and flourish together, then perish the very
      name of Redgauntlet! perish the son of my brother, with every recollection
      of the glories of my family, of the affections of my youth, rather than my
      country&rsquo;s cause should be injured in the tithing of a barley-corn! The
      spirit of Sir Alberick is alive within me at this moment,&rsquo; he continued,
      drawing up his stately form and sitting erect in his saddle, while he
      pressed his finger against his forehead; &lsquo;and if you yourself crossed my
      path in opposition, I swear, by the mark that darkens my brow, that a new
      deed should be done&mdash;a new doom should be deserved!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent, and his threats were uttered in a tone of voice so deeply
      resolute, that Darsie&rsquo;s heart sank within him, when he reflected on the
      storm of passion which he must encounter, if he declined to join his uncle
      in a project to which prudence and principle made him equally adverse. He
      had scarce any hope left but in temporizing until he could make his
      escape, and resolved to avail himself for that purpose of the delay which
      his uncle seemed not unwilling to grant. The stern, gloomy look of his
      companion became relaxed by degrees, and presently afterwards he made a
      sign to Miss Redgauntlet to join the party, and began a forced
      conversation on ordinary topics; in the course of which Darsie observed
      that his sister seemed to speak under the most cautious restraint,
      weighing every word before she uttered it, and always permitting her uncle
      to give the tone to the conversation, though of the most trifling kind.
      This seemed to him (such an opinion had he already entertained of his
      sister&rsquo;s good sense and firmness) the strongest proof he had yet received
      of his uncle&rsquo;s peremptory character, since he saw it observed with so much
      deference by a young person whose sex might have given her privileges, and
      who seemed by no means deficient either in spirit or firmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little cavalcade was now approaching the house of Father Crackenthorp,
      situated, as the reader knows, by the side of the Solway, and not far
      distant front a rude pier, near which lay several fishing-boats, which
      frequently acted in a different capacity. The house of the worthy publican
      was also adapted to the various occupations which he carried on, being a
      large scrambling assemblage of cottages attached to a house of two
      stories, roofed with flags of sandstone&mdash;the original mansion, to
      which the extensions of Mr. Crackenthorp&rsquo;s trade had occasioned his making
      many additions. Instead of the single long watering-trough which usually
      distinguishes the front of the English public-house of the second class,
      there were three conveniences of that kind, for the use, as the landlord
      used to say, of the troop-horses when the soldiers came to search his
      house; while a knowing leer and a nod let you understand what species of
      troops he was thinking of. A huge ash-tree before the door, which had
      reared itself to a great size and height, in spite of the blasts from the
      neighbouring Solway, overshadowed, as usual, the ale-bench, as our
      ancestors called it, where, though it was still early in the day, several
      fellows, who seemed to be gentlemen&rsquo;s servants, were drinking beer and
      smoking. One or two of them wore liveries which seemed known to Mr.
      Redgauntlet, for he muttered between his teeth, &lsquo;Fools, fools! were they
      on a march to hell, they must have their rascals in livery with them, that
      the whole world might know who were going to be damned.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As he thus muttered, he drew bridle before the door of the place, from
      which several other lounging guests began to issue, to look with indolent
      curiosity as usual, upon an ARRIVAL.
    </p>
    <p>
      Redgauntlet sprang from his horse, and assisted his niece to dismount;
      but, forgetting, perhaps, his nephew&rsquo;s disguise, he did not pay him the
      attention which his female dress demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation of Darsie was indeed something awkward; for Cristal Nixon,
      out of caution perhaps to prevent escape, had muffled the extreme folds of
      the riding-skirt with which he was accoutred, around his ankles and under
      his feet, and there secured it with large corking-pins. We presume that
      gentlemen-cavaliers may sometimes cast their eyes to that part of the
      person of the fair equestrians whom they chance occasionally to escort;
      and if they will conceive their own feet, like Darsie&rsquo;s, muffled in such a
      labyrinth of folds and amplitude of robe, as modesty doubtless induces the
      fair creatures to assume upon such occasions, they will allow that, on a
      first attempt, they might find some awkwardness in dismounting. Darsie, at
      least, was in such a predicament, for, not receiving adroit assistance
      from the attendant of Mr. Redgauntlet, he stumbled as he dismounted from
      the horse, and might have had a bad fall, had it not been broken by the
      gallant interposition of a gentleman, who probably was, on his part, a
      little surprised at the solid weight of the distressed fair one whom he
      had the honour to receive in his embrace. But what was his surprise to
      that of Darsie, when the hurry of the moment and of the accident,
      permitted him to see that it was his friend Alan Fairford in whose arms he
      found himself! A thousand apprehensions rushed on him, mingled with the
      full career of hope and joy, inspired by the unexpected appearance of his
      beloved friend at the very crisis, it seemed, of his fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was about to whisper in his ear, cautioning him at the same time to be
      silent; yet he hesitated for a second or two to effect his purpose, since,
      should Redgauntlet take the alarm from any sudden exclamation on the part
      of Alan, there was no saying what consequences might ensue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ere he could decide what was to be done, Redgauntlet, who had entered the
      house, returned hastily, followed by Cristal Nixon. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll release you of
      the charge of this young lady, sir;&rsquo; he said, haughtily, to Alan Fairford,
      whom he probably did not recognize.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had no desire to intrude, sir,&rsquo; replied Alan; &lsquo;the lady&rsquo;s situation
      seemed to require assistance&mdash;and&mdash;but have I not the honour to
      speak to Mr. Herries of Birrenswork?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are mistaken, sir,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet, turning short off, and making a
      sign with his hand to Cristal, who hurried Darsie, however unwillingly,
      into the house, whispering in his ear, &lsquo;Come, miss, let us have no making
      of acquaintance from the windows. Ladies of fashion must be private. Show
      us a room, Father Crackenthorp.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he conducted Darsie into the house, interposing at the same
      time his person betwixt the supposed young lady and the stranger of whom
      he was suspicious, so as to make communication by signs impossible. As
      they entered, they heard the sound of a fiddle in the stone-floored and
      well-sanded kitchen, through which they were about to follow their
      corpulent host, and where several people seemed engaged in dancing to its
      strains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;D&mdash;n thee,&rsquo; said Nixon to Crackenthorp, &lsquo;would you have the lady go
      through all the mob of the parish? Hast thou no more private way to our
      sitting-room?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None that is fit for my travelling,&rsquo; answered the landlord, laying his
      hand on his portly stomach. &lsquo;I am not Tom Turnpenny, to creep like a
      lizard through keyholes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he kept moving on through the revellers in the kitchen; and
      Nixon, holding Darsie by his arm, as if to offer the lady support but in
      all probability to frustrate any effort at escape, moved through the
      crowd, which presented a very motley appearance, consisting of domestic
      servants, country fellows, seamen, and other idlers, whom Wandering Willie
      was regaling with his music.
    </p>
    <p>
      To pass another friend without intimation of his presence would have been
      actual pusillanimity; and just when they were passing the blind man&rsquo;s
      elevated seat, Darsie asked him with some emphasis, whether he could not
      play a Scottish air? The man&rsquo;s face had been the instant before devoid of
      all sort of expression, going through his performance like a clown through
      a beautiful country, too much accustomed to consider it as a task, to take
      any interest in the performance, and, in fact, scarce seeming to hear the
      noise that he was creating. In a word, he might at the time have made a
      companion to my friend Wilkie&rsquo;s inimitable blind crowder. But with
      Wandering Willie this was only an occasional and a rare fit of dullness,
      such as will at times creep over all the professors of the fine arts,
      arising either from fatigue, or contempt of the present audience, or that
      caprice which so often tempts painters and musicians and great actors, in
      the phrase of the latter, to walk through their part, instead of exerting
      themselves with the energy which acquired their fame. But when the
      performer heard the voice of Darsie, his countenance became at once
      illuminated, and showed the complete mistake of those who suppose that the
      principal point of expression depends upon the eyes. With his face turned
      to the point from which the sound came, his upper lip a little curved, and
      quivering with agitation, and with a colour which surprise and pleasure
      had brought at once into his faded cheek, he exchanged the humdrum
      hornpipe which he had been sawing out with reluctant and lazy bow, for the
      fine Scottish air,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  You&rsquo;re welcome, Charlie Stuart,
</pre>
    <p>
      which flew from his strings as if by inspiration and after a breathless
      pause of admiration among the audience, was received with a clamour of
      applause, which seemed to show that the name and tendency, as well as the
      execution of the tune, was in the highest degree acceptable to all the
      party assembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, Cristal Nixon, still keeping hold of Darsie, and
      following the landlord, forced his way with some difficulty through the
      crowded kitchen, and entered a small apartment on the other side of it,
      where they found Lilias Redgauntlet already seated. Here Nixon gave way to
      his suppressed resentment, and turning sternly on Crackenthorp, threatened
      him with his master&rsquo;s severest displeasure, because things were in such
      bad order to receive his family, when he had given such special advice
      that he desired to be private. But Father Crackenthorp was not a man to be
      brow-beaten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, brother Nixon, thou art angry this morning,&rsquo; he replied; &lsquo;hast risen
      from thy wrong side, I think. You know, as well as I, that most of this
      mob is of the squire&rsquo;s own making&mdash;gentlemen that come with their
      servants, and so forth, to meet him in the way of business, as old Tom
      Turnpenny says&mdash;the very last that came was sent down with Dick
      Gardener from Fairladies.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But the blind scraping scoundrel yonder,&rsquo; said Nixon, &lsquo;how dared you take
      such a rascal as that across your threshold at such a time as this? If the
      squire should dream you have a thought of peaching&mdash;I am only
      speaking for your good, Father Crackenthorp.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, look ye, brother Nixon,&rsquo; said Crackenthorp, turning his quid with
      great composure, &lsquo;the squire is a very worthy gentleman, and I&rsquo;ll never
      deny it; but I am neither his servant nor his tenant, and so he need send
      me none of his orders till he hears I have put on his livery. As for
      turning away folk from my door, I might as well plug up the ale-tap, and
      pull down the sign&mdash;and as for peaching, and such like, the squire
      will find the folk here are as honest to the full as those he brings with
      him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How, you impudent lump of tallow,&rsquo; said Nixon, &lsquo;what do you mean by
      that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; said Crackenthorp, &lsquo;but that I can tour out as well as another&mdash;you
      understand me&mdash;keep good lights in my upper story&mdash;know a thing
      or two more than most folk in this country. If folk will come to my house
      on dangerous errands, egad they shall not find Joe Crackenthorp a
      cat&rsquo;s-paw. I&rsquo;ll keep myself clear, you may depend on it, and let every man
      answer for his own actions&mdash;that&rsquo;s my way. Anything wanted, Master
      Nixon?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No&mdash;yes&mdash;begone!&rsquo; said Nixon, who seemed embarrassed with the
      landlord&rsquo;s contumacy, yet desirous to conceal the effect it produced on
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was no sooner closed on Crackenthorp, than Miss Redgauntlet,
      addressing Nixon, commanded him to leave the room and go to his proper
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How, madam?&rsquo; said the fellow sullenly, yet with an air of respect, &lsquo;Would
      you have your uncle pistol me for disobeying his orders?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He may perhaps pistol you for some other reason, if you do not obey
      mine,&rsquo; said Lilias, composedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You abuse your advantage over me, madam&mdash;I really dare not go&mdash;I
      am on guard over this other miss here; and if I should desert my post, my
      life were not worth five minutes&rsquo; purchase.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then know your post, sir,&rsquo; said Lilias, &lsquo;and watch on the outside of the
      door. You have no commission to listen to our private conversation, I
      suppose? Begone, sir, without further speech or remonstrance, or I will
      tell my uncle that which you would have reason to repent be should know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The fellow looked at her with a singular expression of spite, mixed with
      deference. &lsquo;You abuse your advantages, madam,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and act as
      foolishly in doing so as I did in affording you such a hank over me. But
      you are a tyrant; and tyrants have commonly short reigns.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he left the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The wretch&rsquo;s unparalleled insolence,&rsquo; said Lilias to her brother, &lsquo;has
      given me one great advantage over him. For knowing that my uncle would
      shoot him with as little remorse as a woodcock, if he but guessed at his
      brazen-faced assurance towards me, he dares not since that time assume, so
      far as I am concerned, the air of insolent domination which the possession
      of my uncle&rsquo;s secrets, and the knowledge of his most secret plans, have
      led him to exert over others of his family.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the meantime,&rsquo; said Darsie, &lsquo;I am happy to see that the landlord of
      the house does not seem so devoted to him as I apprehended; and this aids
      the hope of escape which I am nourishing for you and for myself. O Lilias!
      the truest of friends, Alan Fairford, is in pursuit of me, and is here at
      this moment. Another humble, but, I think, faithful friend, is also within
      these dangerous walls.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lilias laid her finger on her lips, and pointed to the door. Darsie took
      the hint, lowered his voice, and informed her in whispers of the arrival
      of Fairford, and that he believed he had opened a communication with
      Wandering Willie. She listened with the utmost interest, and had just
      begun to reply, when a loud noise was heard in the kitchen, caused by
      several contending voices, amongst which Darsie thought he could
      distinguish that of Alan Fairford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forgetting how little his own condition permitted him to become the
      assistant of another, Darsie flew to the door of the room, and finding it
      locked and bolted on the outside, rushed against it with all his force,
      and made the most desperate efforts to burst it open, notwithstanding the
      entreaties of his sister that he would compose himself and recollect the
      condition in which he was placed. But the door, framed to withstand
      attacks from excisemen, constables, and other personages, considered as
      worthy to use what are called the king&rsquo;s keys, [In common parlance, a
      crowbar and hatchet.] &lsquo;and therewith to make lockfast places open and
      patent,&rsquo; set his efforts at defiance. Meantime the noise continued
      without, and we are to give an account of its origin in our next chapter.

      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      NARRATIVE OF DARSIE LATIMER, CONTINUED
    </h3>
    <p>
      Joe Crackenthorp&rsquo;s public-house had never, since it first reared its
      chimneys on the banks of the Solway, been frequented by such a
      miscellaneous group of visitors as had that morning become its guests.
      Several of them were persons whose quality seemed much superior to their
      dresses and modes of travelling. The servants who attended them
      contradicted the inferences to be drawn from the garb of their masters,
      and, according to the custom of the knights of the rainbow, gave many
      hints that they were not people to serve any but men of first-rate
      consequence. These gentlemen, who had come thither chiefly for the purpose
      of meeting with Mr. Redgauntlet, seemed moody and anxious, conversed and
      walked together apparently in deep conversation, and avoided any
      communication with the chance travellers whom accident brought that
      morning to the same place of resort.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if Fate had set herself to confound the plans of the Jacobite
      conspirators, the number of travellers was unusually great, their
      appearance respectable, and they filled the public tap-room of the inn,
      where the political guests had already occupied most of the private
      apartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst others, honest Joshua Geddes had arrived, travelling, as he said,
      in the sorrow of the soul, and mourning for the fate of Darsie Latimer as
      he would for his first-born child. He had skirted the whole coast of the
      Solway, besides making various trips into the interior, not shunning, on
      such occasions, to expose himself to the laugh of the scorner, nay, even
      to serious personal risk, by frequenting the haunts of smugglers,
      horse-jockeys, and other irregular persons, who looked on his intrusion
      with jealous eyes, and were apt to consider him as an exciseman in the
      disguise of a Quaker. All this labour and peril, however, had been
      undergone in vain. No search he could make obtained the least intelligence
      of Latimer, so that he began to fear the poor lad had been spirited abroad&mdash;for
      the practice of kidnapping was then not infrequent, especially on the
      western coasts of Britain&mdash;if indeed he had escaped a briefer and
      more bloody fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a heavy heart, he delivered his horse, even Solomon, into the hands
      of the ostler, and walking into the inn, demanded from the landlord
      breakfast and a private room. Quakers, and such hosts as old Father
      Crackenthorp, are no congenial spirits; the latter looked askew over his
      shoulder, and replied, &lsquo;If you would have breakfast here, friend, you are
      like to eat it where other folk eat theirs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And wherefore can I not,&rsquo; said the Quaker, &lsquo;have an apartment to myself,
      for my money?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because, Master Jonathan, you must wait till your betters be served, or
      else eat with your equals.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Joshua Geddes argued the point no further, but sitting quietly down on the
      seat which Crackenthorp indicated to him, and calling for a pint of ale,
      with some bread, butter, and Dutch cheese, began to satisfy the appetite
      which the morning air had rendered unusually alert.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the honest Quaker was thus employed, another stranger entered the
      apartment, and sat down near to the table on which his victuals were
      placed. He looked repeatedly at Joshua, licked his parched and chopped
      lips as he saw the good Quaker masticate his bread and cheese, and sucked
      up his thin chops when Mr. Geddes applied the tankard to his mouth, as if
      the discharge of these bodily functions by another had awakened his
      sympathies in an uncontrollable degree. At last, being apparently unable
      to withstand his longings, he asked, in a faltering tone, the huge
      landlord, who was tramping through the room in all corpulent impatience,
      whether he could have a plack-pie?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never heard of such a thing, master,&rsquo; said the landlord, and was about to
      trudge onward; when the guest, detaining him, said, in a strong Scottish
      tone, &lsquo;Ya will maybe have nae whey then, nor buttermilk, nor ye couldna
      exhibit a souter&rsquo;s clod?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t tell what ye are talking about, master,&rsquo; said Crackenthorp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then ye will have nae breakfast that will come within &lsquo;the compass of a
      shilling Scots?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which is a penny sterling,&rsquo; answered Crackenthorp, with a sneer. &lsquo;Why,
      no, Sawney, I can&rsquo;t say as we have&mdash;we can&rsquo;t afford it; But you shall
      have a bellyful for love, as we say in the bull-ring.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall never refuse a fair offer,&rsquo; said the poverty-stricken guest; &lsquo;and
      I will say that for the English, if they were deils, that they are a
      ceeveleesed people to gentlemen that are under a cloud.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gentlemen!&mdash;humph!&rsquo; said Crackenthorp&mdash;&lsquo;not a blue-cap among
      them but halts upon that foot.&rsquo; Then seizing on a dish which still
      contained a huge cantle of what had been once a princely mutton pasty, he
      placed it on the table before the stranger, saying, &lsquo;There, master
      gentleman; there is what is worth all the black pies, as you call them,
      that were ever made of sheep&rsquo;s head.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sheep&rsquo;s head is a gude thing, for a&rsquo; that,&rsquo; replied the guest; but not
      being spoken so loud as to offend his hospitable entertainer, the
      interjection might pass for a private protest against the scandal thrown
      out against the standing dish of Caledonia.
    </p>
    <p>
      This premised, he immediately began to transfer the mutton and pie-crust
      from his plate to his lips, in such huge gobbets, as if he was refreshing
      after a three days&rsquo; fast, and laying in provisions against a whole Lent to
      come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joshua Geddes in his turn gazed on him with surprise, having never, he
      thought, beheld such a gaunt expression of hunger in the act of eating.
      &lsquo;Friend,&rsquo; he said, after watching him for some minutes, &lsquo;if thou gorgest
      thyself in this fashion, thou wilt assuredly choke. Wilt thou not take a
      draught out of my cup to help down all that dry meat?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Troth,&rsquo; said the stranger, stopping and looking at the friendly
      propounder, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s nae bad overture, as they say in the General Assembly.
      I have heard waur motions than that frae wiser counsel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Geddes ordered a quart of home-brewed to be placed before our friend
      Peter Peebles; for the reader must have already conceived that this
      unfortunate litigant was the wanderer in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      The victim of Themis had no sooner seen the flagon, than he seized it with
      the same energy which he had displayed in operating upon the pie&mdash;puffed
      off the froth with such emphasis, that some of it lighted on Mr. Geddes&rsquo;s
      head&mdash;and then said, as if with it sudden recollection of what was
      due to civility, &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s to ye, friend. What! are ye ower grand to give me
      an answer, or are ye dull o&rsquo; hearing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I prithee drink thy liquor, friend,&rsquo; said the good Quaker; &lsquo;thou meanest
      it in civility, but we care not for these idle fashions.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What! ye are a Quaker, are ye?&rsquo; said Peter; and without further ceremony
      reared the flagon to his head, from which he withdrew it not while a
      single drop of &lsquo;barley-broo&rsquo; remained. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s done you and me muckle
      gude,&rsquo; he said, sighing as he set down his pot; &lsquo;but twa mutchkins o&rsquo; yill
      between twa folk is a drappie ower little measure. What say ye to anither
      pot? or shall we cry in a blithe Scots pint at ance? The yill is no
      amiss.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thou mayst call for what thou wilt on thine own charges, friend,&rsquo; said
      Geddes; &lsquo;for myself, I willingly contribute to the quenching of thy
      natural thirst; but I fear it were no such easy matter to relieve thy
      acquired and artificial drought.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is to say, in plain terms, ye are for withdrawing your caution with
      the folk of the house? You Quaker folk are but fause comforters; but since
      ye have garred me drink sae muckle cauld yill&mdash;me that am no used to
      the like of it in the forenoon&mdash;I think ye might as weel have offered
      me a glass of brandy or usquabae&mdash;I&rsquo;m nae nice body&mdash;I can drink
      onything that&rsquo;s wet and toothsome.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a drop at my cost, friend,&rsquo; quoth Geddes. &lsquo;Thou art an old man, and
      hast perchance a heavy and long journey before thee. Thou art, moreover,
      my countryman, as I judge from thy tongue; and I will not give thee the
      means of dishonouring thy grey hairs in a strange land.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Grey hairs, neighbour!&rsquo; said Peter, with a wink to the bystanders, whom
      this dialogue began to interest, and who were in hopes of seeing the
      Quaker played off by the crazed beggar, for such Peter Peebles appeared to
      be. &lsquo;Grey hairs! The Lord mend your eyesight, neighbour, that disna ken
      grey hairs frae a tow wig!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This jest procured a shout of laughter, and, what was still more
      acceptable than dry applause, a man who stood beside called out, &lsquo;Father
      Crackenthorp, bring a nipperkin of brandy. I&rsquo;ll bestow a dram on this
      fellow, were it but for that very word.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The brandy was immediately brought by a wench who acted as barmaid; and
      Peter, with a grin of delight, filled a glass, quaffed it off, and then
      saying, &lsquo;God bless me! I was so unmannerly as not to drink to ye&mdash;I
      think the Quaker has smitten me wi&rsquo; his ill-bred havings,&rsquo;&mdash;he was
      about to fill another, when his hand was arrested by his new friend; who
      said at the same time, &lsquo;No, no, friend&mdash;fair play&rsquo;s a jewel&mdash;time
      about, if you please.&rsquo; And filling a glass for himself, emptied it as
      gallantly as Peter could have done. &lsquo;What say you to that, friend?&rsquo; he
      continued, addressing the Quaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, friend,&rsquo; answered Joshua, &lsquo;it went down thy throat, not mine; and I
      have nothing to say about what concerns me not; but if thou art a man of
      humanity, thou wilt not give this poor creature the means of debauchery.
      Bethink thee that they will spurn him from the door, as they would do a
      houseless and masterless dog, and that he may die on the sands or on the
      common. And if he has through thy means been rendered incapable of helping
      himself, thou shalt not be innocent of his blood.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Faith, Broadbrim, I believe thou art right, and the old gentleman in the
      flaxen jazy shall have no more of the comforter. Besides, we have business
      in hand to-day, and this fellow, for as mad as he looks, may have a nose
      on his face after all. Hark ye, father,&mdash;what is your name, and what
      brings you into such an out-of-the-way corner?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not just free to condescend on my name,&rsquo; said Peter; &lsquo;and as for my
      business&mdash;there is a wee dribble of brandy in the stoup&mdash;it
      would be wrang to leave it to the lass&mdash;it is learning her bad
      usages.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, thou shalt have the brandy, and be d&mdash;d to thee, if thou wilt
      tell me what you are making here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Seeking a young advocate chap that they ca&rsquo; Alan Fairford, that has
      played me a slippery trick, and ye maun ken a&rsquo; about the cause,&rsquo; said
      Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An advocate, man!&rsquo; answered the captain of the JUMPING JENNY&mdash;for it
      was he, and no other, who had taken compassion on Peter&rsquo;s drought; &lsquo;why,
      Lord help thee, thou art on the wrong side of the Firth to seek advocates,
      whom I take to be Scottish lawyers, not English.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;English lawyers, man!&rsquo; exclaimed Peter, &lsquo;the deil a lawyer&rsquo;s in a&rsquo; 
      England.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish from my soul it were true,&rsquo; said Ewart; &lsquo;but what the devil put
      that in your head?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lord, man, I got a grip of ane of their attorneys in Carlisle, and he
      tauld me that there wasna a lawyer in England ony mair than himsell that
      kend the nature of a multiple-poinding! And when I told him how this loopy
      lad, Alan Fairford, had served me, he said I might bring an action on the
      case&mdash;just as if the case hadna as mony actions already as one case
      can weel carry. By my word, it is a gude case, and muckle has it borne, in
      its day, of various procedure&mdash;but it&rsquo;s the barley-pickle breaks the
      naig&rsquo;s back, and wi&rsquo; my consent it shall not hae ony mair burden laid upon
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But this Alan Fairford?&rsquo; said Nanty&mdash;&lsquo;come&mdash;sip up the drop of
      brandy, man, and tell me some more about him, and whether you are seeking
      him for good or for harm.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For my ain gude, and for his harm, to be sure,&rsquo; said Peter. &lsquo;Think of his
      having left my cause in the dead-thraw between the tyneing and the
      winning, and capering off into Cumberland here, after a wild
      loup-the-tether lad they ca&rsquo; Darsie Latimer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Darsie Latimer!&rsquo; said Mr. Geddes, hastily; &lsquo;do you know anything of
      Darsie Latimer?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Maybe I do, and maybe I do not,&rsquo; answered Peter; &lsquo;I am no free to answer
      every body&rsquo;s interrogatory, unless it is put judicially, and by form of
      law&mdash;specially where folk think so much of a caup of sour yill, or a
      thimblefu&rsquo; of brandy. But as for this gentleman, that has shown himself a
      gentleman at breakfast, and will show himself a gentleman at the meridian,
      I am free to condescend upon any points in the cause that may appear to
      bear upon the question at issue.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, all I want to know from you, my friend, is, whether you are seeking
      to do this Mr. Alan Fairford good or harm; because if you come to do him
      good, I think you could maybe get speech of him&mdash;and if to do him
      harm, I will take the liberty to give you a cast across the Firth, with
      fair warning not to come back on such an errand, lest worse come of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The manner and language of Ewart were such that Joshua Geddes resolved to
      keep cautious silence, till he could more plainly discover whether he was
      likely to aid or impede him in his researches after Darsie Latimer. He
      therefore determined to listen attentively to what should pass between
      Peter and the seaman, and to watch for an opportunity of questioning the
      former, so soon as he should be separated from his new acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wad by no means,&rsquo; said Peter Peebles, &lsquo;do any substantial harm to the
      poor lad Fairford, who has had mony a gowd guinea of mine, as weel as his
      father before him; but I wad hae him brought back to the minding of my
      business and his ain; and maybe I wadna insist further in my action of
      damages against him, than for refunding the fees, and for some annual rent
      on the principal sum due frae the day on which he should have recovered it
      for me, plack and bawbee, at the great advising; for ye are aware, that is
      the least that I can ask NOMINE DAMNI; and I have nae thought to break
      down the lad bodily a&rsquo;thegither&mdash;we maun live and let live&mdash;forgie
      and forget.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The deuce take me, friend Broadbrim,&rsquo; said Nanty Ewart, looking to the
      Quaker, &lsquo;if I can make out what this old scarecrow means. If I thought it
      was fitting that Master Fairford should see him, why perhaps it is a
      matter that could be managed. Do you know anything about the old fellow?&mdash;you
      seemed to take some charge of him just now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No more than I should have done by any one in distress,&rsquo; said Geddes, not
      sorry to be appealed to; &lsquo;but I will try what I can do to find out who he
      is, and what he is about in this country. But are we not a little too
      public in this open room?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s well thought of,&rsquo; said Nanty; and at his command the barmaid ushered
      the party into a side-booth, Peter attending them in the instinctive hope
      that there would be more liquor drunk among them before parting. They had
      scarce sat down in their new apartment, when the sound of a violin was
      heard in the room which they had just left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll awa back yonder,&rsquo; said Peter, rising up again; &lsquo;yon&rsquo;s the sound of a
      fiddle, and when there is music, there&rsquo;s ay something ganging to eat or
      drink.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am just going to order something here,&rsquo; said the Quaker; &lsquo;but in the
      meantime, have you any objection, my good friend, to tell us your name?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None in the world, if you are wanting to drink to me by name and
      surname,&rsquo; answered Peebles; &lsquo;but, otherwise, I would rather evite your
      interrogatories.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Friend,&rsquo; said the Quaker, &lsquo;it is not for thine own health, seeing thou
      hast drunk enough already&mdash;however&mdash;here, handmaiden&mdash;bring
      me a gill of sherry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sherry&rsquo;s but shilpit drink, and a gill&rsquo;s a sma&rsquo; measure for twa gentlemen
      to crack ower at their first acquaintance. But let us see your sneaking
      gill of sherry,&rsquo; said Poor Peter, thrusting forth his huge hand to seize
      on the diminutive pewter measure, which, according to the fashion of the
      time, contained the generous liquor freshly drawn from the butt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, hold, friend,&rsquo; said Joshua, &lsquo;thou hast not yet told me what name and
      surname I am to call thee by.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;D&mdash;d sly in the Quaker,&rsquo; said Nanty, apart, &lsquo;to make him pay for his
      liquor before he gives it him. Now, I am such a fool, that I should have
      let him get too drunk to open his mouth, before I thought of asking him a
      question.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My name is Peter Peebles, then,&rsquo; said the litigant, rather sulkily, as
      one who thought his liquor too sparingly meted out to him; &lsquo;and what have
      you to say to that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Peter Peebles?&rsquo; repeated Nanty Ewart and seemed to muse upon something
      which the words brought to his remembrance, while the Quaker pursued his
      examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I prithee, Peter Peebles, what is thy further designation? Thou
      knowest, in our country, that some men are distinguished by their craft
      and calling, as cordwainers, fishers, weavers, or the like, and some by
      their titles as proprietors of land (which savours of vanity)&mdash;now,
      how may you be distinguished from others of the same name?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As Peter Peebles of the great plea of Poor Peter Peebles against
      Plainstanes, ET PER CONTRA&mdash;if I am laird of naething else, I am ay a
      DOMINUS LITIS.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s but a poor lairdship, I doubt,&rsquo; said Joshua.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray, Mr. Peebles,&rsquo; said Nanty, interrupting the conversation abruptly,
      &lsquo;were not you once a burgess of Edinburgh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;WAS I a burgess!&rsquo; said Peter indignantly, &lsquo;and AM I not a burgess even
      now? I have done nothing to forfeit my right, I trow&mdash;once provost
      and ay my lord.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Mr. Burgess, tell me further, have you not some property in the
      Gude Town?&rsquo; continued Ewart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Troth have I&mdash;that is, before my misfortunes, I had twa or three
      bonny bits of mailings amang the closes and wynds, forby the shop and the
      story abune it. But Plainstanes has put me to the causeway now. Never mind
      though, I will be upsides with him yet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Had not you once a tenement in the Covenant Close?&rsquo; again demanded Nanty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have hit it, lad, though ye look not like a Covenanter,&rsquo; said Peter;
      &lsquo;we&rsquo;ll drink to its memory&mdash;(Hout! the heart&rsquo;s at the mouth o&rsquo; that
      ill-faur&rsquo;d bit stoup already!)&mdash;it brought a rent, reckoning from the
      crawstep to the groundsill, that ye might ca&rsquo; fourteen punds a year, forby
      the laigh cellar that was let to Lucky Littleworth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And do you not remember that you had a poor old lady for your tenant,
      Mrs. Cantrips of Kittlebasket?&rsquo; said Nanty, suppressing his emotion with
      difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Remember! G&mdash;d, I have gude cause to remember her,&rsquo; said Peter, &lsquo;for
      she turned a dyvour on my hands, the auld besom! and after a&rsquo; that the law
      could do to make me satisfied and paid, in the way of poinding and
      distrenzieing and sae forth, as the law will, she ran awa to the charity
      workhouse, a matter of twenty punds Scots in my debt&mdash;it&rsquo;s a great
      shame and oppression that charity workhouse, taking in bankrupt dyvours
      that canna, pay their honest creditors.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Methinks, friend,&rsquo; said the Quaker, &lsquo;thine own rags might teach thee
      compassion for other people&rsquo;s nakedness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rags!&rsquo; said Peter, taking Joshua&rsquo;s words literally; &lsquo;does ony wise body
      put on their best coat when they are travelling, and keeping company with
      Quakers, and such other cattle as the road affords?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The old lady DIED, I have heard,&rsquo; said Nanty, affecting a moderation
      which was belied by accents that faltered with passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She might live or die, for what I care,&rsquo; answered Peter the Cruel; &lsquo;what
      business have folk to do to live that canna live as law will, and satisfy
      their just and lawful creditors?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you&mdash;you that are now yourself trodden down in the very kennel,
      are you not sorry for what you have done? Do you not repent having
      occasioned the poor widow woman&rsquo;s death?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What for should I repent?&rsquo; said Peter; &lsquo;the law was on my side&mdash;a
      decreet of the bailies, followed by poinding, and an act of warding&mdash;a
      suspension intented, and the letters found orderly proceeded. I followed
      the auld rudas through twa courts&mdash;she cost me mair money than her
      lugs were worth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, by Heaven!&rsquo; said Nanty, &lsquo;I would give a thousand guineas, if I had
      them, to have you worth my beating! Had you said you repented, it had been
      between God and your conscience; but to hear you boast of your villany&mdash;Do
      you think it little to have reduced the aged to famine, and the young to
      infamy&mdash;to have caused the death of one woman, the ruin of another,
      and to have driven a man to exile and despair? By Him that made me, I can
      scarce keep hands off you!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Off me? I defy ye!&rsquo; said Peter. &lsquo;I take this honest man to witness that
      if ye stir the neck of my collar, I will have my action for stouthreif,
      spulzie, oppression, assault and battery. Here&rsquo;s a bra&rsquo; din, indeed, about
      an auld wife gaun to the grave, a young limmer to the close-heads and
      causeway, and a sticket stibbler [A student of divinity who has not been
      able to complete his studies on theology.] to the sea instead of the
      gallows!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, by my soul,&rsquo; said Nanty, &lsquo;this is too much! and since you can feel
      no otherwise, I will try if I cannot beat some humanity into your head and
      shoulders.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew his hanger as he spoke, and although Joshua, who had in vain
      endeavoured to interrupt the dialogue to which he foresaw a violent
      termination, now threw himself between Nanty and the old litigant, he
      could not prevent the latter from receiving two or three sound slaps over
      the shoulder with the flat side of the weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Peter Peebles, as inglorious in his extremity as he had been
      presumptuous in bringing it on, now ran and roared, and bolted out of the
      apartment and house itself, pursued by Nanty, whose passion became high in
      proportion to his giving way to its dictates, and by Joshua, who still
      interfered at every risk, calling upon Nanty to reflect on the age and
      miserable circumstances of the offender, and upon Poor Peter to stand and
      place himself under his protection. In front of the house, however, Peter
      Peebles found a more efficient protector than the worthy Quaker.

      CHAPTER XXI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      NARRATIVE OF ALAN FAIRFORD
    </h3>
    <p>
      Our readers may recollect that Fairford had been conducted by Dick
      Gardener from the house of Fairladies to the inn of old Father
      Crackenthorp, in order, as he had been informed by the mysterious Father
      Buonaventure, that he might have the meeting which he desired with Mr.
      Redgauntlet, to treat with him for the liberty of his friend Darsie. His
      guide, by the special direction of Mr. Ambrose, had introduced him into
      the public-house by a back-door, and recommended to the landlord to
      accommodate him with a private apartment, and to treat him with all
      civility; but in other respects to keep his eye on him, and even to secure
      his person, if he saw any reason to suspect him to be a spy. He was not,
      however, subjected to any direct restraint, but was ushered into an
      apartment where he was requested to await the arrival of the gentleman
      with whom he wished to have an interview, and who, as Crackenthorp
      assured, him with a significant nod, would be certainly there in the
      course of an hour. In the meanwhile, he recommended to him, with another
      significant sign, to keep his apartment, &lsquo;as there were people in the
      house who were apt to busy themselves about other folk&rsquo;s matters.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan Fairford complied with the recommendation, so long as he thought it
      reasonable; but when, among a large party riding up to the house, he
      discerned Redgauntlet, whom he had seen under the name of Mr. Herries of
      Birrenswork, and whom, by his height and strength, he easily distinguished
      from the rest, he thought it proper to go down to the front of the house,
      in hopes that, by more closely reconnoitring the party, he might discover
      if his friend Darsie was among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader is aware that, by doing so, he had an opportunity of breaking
      Darsie&rsquo;s fall from his side-saddle, although his disguise and mask
      prevented his recognizing his friend. It may be also recollected that
      while Nixon hurried Miss Redgauntlet and her brother into the house, their
      uncle, somewhat chafed at an unexpected and inconvenient interruption,
      remained himself in parley with Fairford, who had already successively
      addressed him by the names of Herries and Redgauntlet; neither of which,
      any more than the acquaintance of the young lawyer, he seemed at the
      moment willing to acknowledge, though an air of haughty indifference,
      which he assumed, could not conceal his vexation and embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If we must needs be acquainted, sir,&rsquo; he said at last&mdash;&lsquo;for which I
      am unable to see any necessity, especially as I am now particularly
      disposed to be private&mdash;I must entreat you will tell me at once what
      you have to say, and permit me to attend to matters of more importance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My introduction,&rsquo; said Fairford, &lsquo;is contained in this letter.&mdash;(Delivering
      that of Maxwell.)&mdash;I am convinced that, under whatever name it may be
      your pleasure for the present to be known, it is into your hands, and
      yours only, that it should be delivered.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Redgauntlet turned the letter in his hand&mdash;then read the contents
      then again looked upon the letter, and sternly observed, &lsquo;The seal of the
      letter has been broken. Was this the case, sir, when it was delivered into
      your hand?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fairford despised a falsehood as much as any man,&mdash;unless, perhaps,
      as Tom Turnpenny might have said, &lsquo;in the way of business.&rsquo; He answered
      readily and firmly, &lsquo;The seal was whole when the letter was delivered to
      me by Mr. Maxwell of Summertrees.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And did you dare, sir, to break the seal of a letter addressed to me?&rsquo; 
      said Redgauntlet, not sorry, perhaps, to pick a quarrel upon a point
      foreign to the tenor of the epistle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have never broken the seal of any letter committed to my charge,&rsquo; said
      Alan; &lsquo;not from fear of those to whom such letter might be addressed, but
      from respect to myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is well worded,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet; &lsquo;and yet, young Mr. Counsellor, I
      doubt whether your delicacy prevented your reading my letter, or listening
      to the contents as read by some other person after it was opened.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I certainly did hear the contents read over,&rsquo; said Fairford; &lsquo;and they
      were such as to surprise me a good deal.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now that,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet, &lsquo;I hold to be pretty much the same, IN FORO
      CONSCIENTIAE, as if you had broken the seal yourself. I shall hold myself
      excused from entering upon further discourse with a messenger so
      faithless; and you may thank yourself if your journey has been fruitless.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay, sir,&rsquo; said Fairford; &lsquo;and know that I became acquainted with the
      contents of the paper without my consent&mdash;I may even say, against my
      will; for Mr. Buonaventure&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who?&rsquo; demanded Redgauntlet, in a wild and alarmed manner&mdash;&lsquo;WHOM was
      it you named?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Father Buonaventure,&rsquo; said Alan,&mdash;&lsquo;a Catholic priest, as I
      apprehend, whom I saw at the Misses Arthuret&rsquo;s house, called Fairladies.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Misses Arthuret!&mdash;Fairladies!&mdash;A Catholic priest!&mdash;Father
      Buonaventure!&rsquo; said Redgauntlet, repeating the words of Alan with
      astonishment.&mdash;&lsquo;Is it possible that human rashness can reach such a
      point of infatuation? Tell me the truth, I conjure you, sir. I have the
      deepest interest to know whether this is more than an idle legend, picked
      up from hearsay about the country. You are a lawyer, and know the risk
      incurred by the Catholic clergy, whom the discharge of their duty sends to
      these bloody shores.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am a lawyer, certainly,&rsquo; said Fairford; &lsquo;but my holding such a
      respectable condition in life warrants that I am neither an informer nor a
      spy. Here is sufficient evidence that I have seen Father Buonaventure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He put Buonaventure&rsquo;s letter into Redgauntlet&rsquo;s hand, and watched his
      looks closely while he read it. &lsquo;Double-dyed infatuation!&rsquo; he muttered,
      with looks in which sorrow, displeasure, and anxiety were mingled. &lsquo;&ldquo;Save
      me from the indiscretion of my friends,&rdquo; says the Spaniard; &ldquo;I can save
      myself from the hostility of my enemies.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He then read the letter attentively, and for two or three minutes was lost
      in thought, while some purpose of importance seemed to have gathered and
      sit brooding upon his countenance. He held up his finger towards his
      satellite, Cristal Nixon, who replied to his signal with a prompt nod; and
      with one or two of the attendants approached Fairford in such a manner as
      to make him apprehensive they were about to lay hold of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a noise was heard from withinside of the house, and
      presently rushed forth Peter Peebles, pursued by Nanty Ewart with his
      drawn hanger, and the worthy Quaker, who was endeavouring to prevent
      mischief to others, at some risk of bringing it on himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wilder and yet a more absurd figure can hardly be imagined, than that of
      Poor Peter clattering along as fast as his huge boots would permit him,
      and resembling nothing so much as a flying scarecrow; while the thin
      emaciated form of Nanty Ewart, with the hue of death on his cheek, and the
      fire of vengeance glancing from his eye, formed a ghastly contrast with
      the ridiculous object of his pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Redgauntlet threw himself between them. &lsquo;What extravagant folly is this?&rsquo; 
      he said. &lsquo;Put up your weapon, captain. Is this a time to indulge in
      drunken brawls, or is such a miserable object as that a fitting antagonist
      for a man of courage?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg pardon,&rsquo; said the captain, sheathing his weapon&mdash;&lsquo;I was a
      little bit out of the way, to be sure; but to know the provocation, a man
      must read my heart, and that I hardly dare to do myself. But the wretch is
      safe from me. Heaven has done its own vengeance on us both.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      While he spoke in this manner, Peter Peebles, who had at first crept
      behind Redgauntlet in bodily fear, began now to reassume his spirits.
      Pulling his protector by the sleeve, &lsquo;Mr. Herries&mdash;Mr. Herries,&rsquo; he
      whispered, eagerly, &lsquo;ye have done me mair than ae gude turn, and if ye
      will but do me anither at this dead pinch, I&rsquo;ll forgie the girded keg of
      brandy that you and Captain Sir Harry Redgimlet drank out yon time. Ye
      sall hae an ample discharge and renunciation, and, though I should see you
      walking at the Cross of Edinburgh, or standing at the bar of the Court of
      Justiciary, no the very thumbikins themselves should bring to my memory
      that ever I saw you in arms yon day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He accompanied this promise by pulling so hard at Redgauntlet&rsquo;s cloak,
      that he at last turned round. &lsquo;Idiot! speak in a word what you want.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aweel, aweel. In a word, then,&rsquo; said Peter Peebles, &lsquo;I have a warrant on
      me to apprehend that man that stands there, Alan Fairford by name, and
      advocate by calling. I bought it from Maister Justice Foxley&rsquo;s clerk,
      Maister Nicholas Faggot, wi&rsquo; the guinea that you gied me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; said Redgauntlet, &lsquo;hast thou really such a warrant? let me see it.
      Look sharp that no one escape, Cristal Nixon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter produced a huge, greasy, leathern pocketbook, too dirty to permit
      its original colour to be visible, filled with scrolls of notes, memorials
      to counsel, and Heaven knows what besides. From amongst this precious mass
      he culled forth a paper, and placed it in the hands of Redgauntlet, or
      Herries, as he continued to call him, saying, at the same time, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a
      formal and binding warrant, proceeding on my affidavy made, that the said
      Alan Fairford, being lawfully engaged in my service, had slipped the
      tether and fled over the Border, and was now lurking there and
      thereabouts, to elude and evite the discharge of his bounden duty to me;
      and therefore granting warrant to constables and others, to seek for,
      take, and apprehend him, that he may be brought before the Honourable
      Justice Foxley for examination, and, if necessary, for commitment. Now,
      though a&rsquo; this be fairly set down, as I tell ye, yet where am I to get an
      officer to execute this warrant in sic a country as this, where swords and
      pistols flee out at a word&rsquo;s speaking, and folk care as little for the
      peace of King George as the peace of Auld King Coul? There&rsquo;s that drunken
      skipper, and that wet Quaker, enticed me into the public this morning, and
      because I wadna gie them&rsquo; as much brandy as wad have made them
      blind-drunk, they baith fell on me, and were in the way of guiding me very
      ill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      While Peter went on in this manner, Redgauntlet glanced his eye over the
      warrant, and immediately saw that it must be a trick passed by Nicholas
      Faggot, to cheat the poor insane wretch out of his solitary guinea. But
      the Justice had actually subscribed it, as he did whatever his clerk
      presented to him, and Redgauntlet resolved to use it for his own purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without making any direct answer, therefore, to Peter Peebles, he walked
      up gravely to Fairford, who had waited quietly for the termination of a
      scene in which he was not a little surprised to find his client, Mr.
      Peebles, a conspicuous actor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Fairford,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet, &lsquo;there are many reasons which might
      induce me to comply with the request, or rather the injunctions, of the
      excellent Father Buonaventure, that I should communicate with you upon the
      present condition of my ward, whom you know under the name of Darsie
      Latimer; but no man is better aware than you that the law must be obeyed,
      even in contradiction to our own feelings; now this poor man has obtained
      a warrant for carrying you before a magistrate, and, I am afraid, there is
      a necessity of your yielding to it, although to the postponement of the
      business which you may have with me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A warrant against me!&rsquo; said Alan, indignantly; &lsquo;and at that poor
      miserable wretch&rsquo;s instance?&mdash;why, this is a trick, a mere and most
      palpable trick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It may be so,&rsquo; replied Redgauntlet, with great equanimity; &lsquo;doubtless you
      know best; only the writ appears regular, and with that respect for the
      law which has been,&rsquo; he said, with hypocritical formality, &lsquo;a leading
      feature of my character through life, I cannot dispense with giving my
      poor aid to the support of a legal warrant. Look at it yourself, and be
      satisfied it is no trick of mine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fairford ran over the affidavit and the warrant, and then exclaimed once
      more, that it was an impudent imposition, and that he would hold those who
      acted upon such a warrant liable in the highest damages. &lsquo;I guess at your
      motive, Mr. Redgauntlet,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;for acquiescing in so ridiculous a
      proceeding. But be assured you will find that, in this country, one act of
      illegal violence will not be covered or atoned for by practising another.
      You cannot, as a man of sense and honour, pretend to say you regard this
      as a legal warrant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am no lawyer, sir,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet; &lsquo;and pretend not to know what is
      or is not law&mdash;the warrant is quite formal, and that is enough for
      me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did ever any one hear,&rsquo; said Fairford, &lsquo;of an advocate being compelled to
      return to his task, like a collier or a salter [See Note 10.] who has
      deserted his master?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see no reason why he should not,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet, dryly, &lsquo;unless on
      the ground that the services of the lawyer are the most expensive and
      least useful of the two.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You cannot mean this in earnest,&rsquo; said Fairford; &lsquo;you cannot really mean
      to avail yourself of so poor a contrivance, to evade the word pledged by
      your friend, your ghostly father, in my behalf. I may have been a fool for
      trusting it too easily, but think what you must be if you can abuse my
      confidence in this manner. I entreat you to reflect that this usage
      releases me from all promises of secrecy or connivance at what I am apt to
      think are very dangerous practices, and that&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hark ye, Mr. Fairford,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet; &lsquo;I must here interrupt you for
      your own sake. One word of betraying what you may have seen, or what you
      may have suspected, and your seclusion is like to have either a very
      distant or a very brief termination; in either case a most undesirable
      one. At present, you are sure of being at liberty in a very few days&mdash;perhaps
      much sooner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And my friend,&rsquo; said Alan Fairford, &lsquo;for whose sake I have run myself
      into this danger, what is to become of him? Dark and dangerous man!&rsquo; he
      exclaimed, raising his voice, I will not be again cajoled by deceitful
      promises&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I give you my honour that your friend is well,&rsquo; interrupted Redgauntlet;
      &lsquo;perhaps I may permit you to see him, if you will but submit with patience
      to a fate which is inevitable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Alan Fairford, considering his confidence as having been abused, first
      by Maxwell, and next by the priest, raised his voice, and appealed to all
      the king&rsquo;s lieges within hearing, against the violence with which he was
      threatened. He was instantly seized on by Nixon and two assistants, who,
      holding down his arms, and endeavouring to stop his mouth, were about to
      hurry him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The honest Quaker, who had kept out of Redgauntlet&rsquo;s presence, now came
      boldly forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Friend,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;thou dost more than thou canst answer. Thou knowest me
      well, and thou art aware that in me thou hast a deeply injured neighbour,
      who was dwelling beside thee in the honesty and simplicity of his heart.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tush, Jonathan,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet; &lsquo;talk not to me, man; it is neither
      the craft of a young lawyer, nor the SIMPLICITY of an old hypocrite, can
      drive me from my purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By my faith,&rsquo; said the captain, coming forward in his turn, &lsquo;this is
      hardly fair, general; and I doubt,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;whether the will of my
      owners can make me a party to such proceedings. Nay, never fumble with
      your sword-hilt, but out with it like a man, if you are for a tilting.&rsquo; He
      unsheathed his hanger, and continued&mdash;&lsquo;I will neither see my comrade
      Fairford, nor the old Quaker, abused. D&mdash;&mdash;n all warrants, false
      or true&mdash;curse the justice&mdash;confound the constable!&mdash;and
      here stands little Nanty Ewart to make good what he says against gentle
      and simple, in spite of horse-shoe or horse-radish either.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The cry of &lsquo;Down with all warrants!&rsquo; was popular in the ears of the
      militia of the inn, and Nanty Ewart was no less so. Fishers, ostlers,
      seamen, smugglers, began to crowd to the spot. Crackenthorp endeavoured in
      vain to mediate. The attendants of Redgauntlet began to handle their
      firearms; but their master shouted to them to forbear, and, unsheathing
      his sword as quick as lightning, he rushed on Ewart in the midst of his
      bravado, and struck his weapon from his hand with such address and force,
      that it flew three yards from him. Closing with him at the same moment, he
      gave him a severe fall, and waved his sword over his head, to show he was
      absolutely at his mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, you drunken vagabond,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I give you your life&mdash;you
      are no bad fellow if you could keep from brawling among your friends. But
      we all know Nanty Ewart,&rsquo; he said to the crowd around, with a forgiving
      laugh, which, joined to the awe his prowess had inspired, entirely
      confirmed their wavering allegiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      They shouted, &lsquo;The laird for ever!&rsquo; while poor Nanty, rising from the
      earth, on whose lap he had been stretched so rudely, went in quest of his
      hanger, lifted it, wiped it, and, as he returned the weapon to the
      scabbard, muttered between his teeth, &lsquo;It is true they say of him, and the
      devil will stand his friend till his hour come; I will cross him no more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he slunk from the crowd, cowed and disheartened by his defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For you, Joshua Geddes,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet, approaching the Quaker, who,
      with lifted hands and eyes, had beheld the scene of violence, &lsquo;l shall
      take the liberty to arrest thee for a breach of the peace, altogether
      unbecoming thy pretended principles; and I believe it will go hard with
      thee both in a court of justice and among thine own Society of Friends, as
      they call themselves, who will be but indifferently pleased to see the
      quiet tenor of their hypocrisy insulted by such violent proceedings.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I violent!&rsquo; said Joshua; &lsquo;I do aught unbecoming the principles of the
      Friends! I defy thee, man, and I charge thee, as a Christian, to forbear
      vexing my soul with such charges: it is grievous enough to me to have seen
      violences which I was unable to prevent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O Joshua, Joshua!&rsquo; said Redgauntlet, with a sardonic smile; &lsquo;thou light
      of the faithful in the town of Dumfries and the places adjacent, wilt thou
      thus fall away from the truth? Hast thou not, before us all, attempted to
      rescue a man from the warrant of law? Didst thou not encourage that
      drunken fellow to draw his weapon&mdash;and didst thou not thyself
      flourish thy cudgel in the cause? Think&rsquo;st thou that the oaths of the
      injured Peter Peebles, and the conscientious Cristal Nixon, besides those
      of such gentlemen as look on this strange scene, who not only put on
      swearing as a garment, but to whom, in Custom House matters, oaths are
      literally meat and drink,&mdash;dost thou not think, I say, that these
      men&rsquo;s oaths will go further than thy Yea and Nay in this matter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will swear to anything,&rsquo; said Peter. &lsquo;All is fair when it comes to an
      oath AD LITEM.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You do me foul wrong,&rsquo; said the Quaker, undismayed by the general laugh.
      &lsquo;I encouraged no drawing of weapons, though I attempted to move an unjust
      man by some use of argument&mdash;I brandished no cudgel, although it may
      be that the ancient Adam struggled within me, and caused my hand to grasp
      mine oaken staff firmer than usual, when I saw innocence borne down with
      violence. But why talk I what is true and just to thee, who hast been a
      man of violence from thy youth upwards? Let me rather speak to thee such
      language as thou canst comprehend. Deliver these young men up to me,&rsquo; he
      said, when he had led Redgauntlet a little apart from the crowd, &lsquo;and I
      will not only free thee from the heavy charge of damages which thou hast
      incurred by thine outrage upon my property, but I will add ransom for them
      and for myself. What would it profit thee to do the youths wrong, by
      detaining them in captivity?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Geddes,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet, in a tone more respectful than he had
      hitherto used to the Quaker, &lsquo;your language is disinterested, and I
      respect the fidelity of your friendship. Perhaps we have mistaken each
      other&rsquo;s principles and motives; but if so, we have not at present time for
      explanation. Make yourself easy. I hope to raise your friend Darsie
      Latimer to a pitch of eminence which you will witness with pleasure;&mdash;nay,
      do not attempt to answer me. The other young man shall suffer restraint a
      few days, probably only a few hours,&mdash;it is not more than due for his
      pragmatical interference in what concerned him not. Do you, Mr. Geddes, be
      so prudent as to take your horse and leave this place, which is growing
      every moment more unfit for the abode of a man of peace. You may wait the
      event in safety at Mount Sharon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Friend,&rsquo; replied Joshua, &lsquo;I cannot comply with thy advice; I will remain
      here, even as thy prisoner, as thou didst but now threaten, rather than
      leave the youth who hath suffered by and through me and my misfortunes, in
      his present state of doubtful safety. Wherefore I will not mount my steed
      Solomon; neither will I turn his head towards Mount Sharon, until I see an
      end of this matter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A prisoner, then, you must be,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet. &lsquo;I have no time to
      dispute the matter further with you. But tell me for what you fix your
      eyes so attentively on yonder people of mine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To speak the truth,&rsquo; said the Quaker, &lsquo;I admire to behold among them a
      little wretch of a boy called Benjie, to whom I think Satan has given the
      power of transporting himself wheresoever mischief is going forward; so
      that it may be truly said, there is no evil in this land wherein he hath
      not a finger, if not a whole hand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy, who saw their eyes fixed on him as they spoke, seemed
      embarrassed, slid rather desirous of making his escape; but at a signal
      from Redgauntlet he advanced, assuming the sheepish look and rustic manner
      with which the jackanapes covered much acuteness and roguery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How long have you been with the party, sirrah?&rsquo; said Redgauntlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Since the raid on the stake-nets,&rsquo; said Benjie, with his finger in his
      mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what made you follow us?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dauredna stay at hame for the constables,&rsquo; replied the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what have you been doing all this time?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Doing, sir? I dinna ken what ye ca&rsquo; doing&mdash;I have been doing
      naething,&rsquo; said Benjie; then seeing something in Redgauntlet&rsquo;s eye which
      was not to be trifled with, he added, &lsquo;Naething but waiting on Maister
      Cristal Nixon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hum!&mdash;aye&mdash;indeed?&rsquo; muttered Redgauntlet. &lsquo;Must Master Nixon
      bring his own retinue into the field? This must be seen to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was about to pursue his inquiry, when Nixon himself came to him with
      looks of anxious haste, &lsquo;The Father is come,&rsquo; he whispered, &lsquo;and the
      gentlemen are getting together in the largest room of the house, and they
      desire to see you. Yonder is your nephew, too, making a noise like a man
      in Bedlam.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will look to it all instantly,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet. &lsquo;Is the Father lodged
      as I directed?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cristal nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, then, for the final trial,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet. He folded his hands&mdash;looked
      upwards&mdash;crossed himself&mdash;and after this act of devotion (almost
      the first which any one had observed him make use of) he commanded Nixon
      to keep good watch&mdash;have his horses and men ready for every emergence&mdash;look
      after the safe custody of the prisoners&mdash;but treat them at the same
      time well and civilly. And, these orders given, he darted hastily into the
      house.

      CHAPTER XXII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      NARRATIVE CONTINUED
    </h3>
    <p>
      Redgauntlet&rsquo;s first course was to the chamber of his nephew. He unlocked
      the door, entered the apartment, and asked what he wanted, that he made so
      much noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want my liberty,&rsquo; said Darsie, who had wrought himself up to a pitch of
      passion in which his uncle&rsquo;s wrath had lost its terrors. &lsquo;I desire my
      liberty, and to be assured of the safety of my beloved friend, Alan
      Fairford, whose voice I heard but now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your liberty shall be your own within half an hour from this period&mdash;your
      friend shall be also set at freedom in due time&mdash;and you yourself be
      permitted to have access to his place of confinement.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This does not satisfy me,&rsquo; said Darsie; &lsquo;I must see my friend instantly;
      he is here, and he is here endangered on my account only&mdash;I have
      heard violent exclamations&mdash;the clash of swords. You will gain no
      point with me unless I have ocular demonstration of his safety.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Arthur&mdash;dearest nephew,&rsquo; answered Redgauntlet, &lsquo;drive me not mad!
      Thine own fate&mdash;that of thy house&mdash;that of thousands&mdash;that
      of Britain herself, are at this moment in the scales; and you are only
      occupied about the safety of a poor insignificant pettifogger!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has sustained injury at your hands, then?&rsquo; said Darsie, fiercely. &lsquo;I
      know he has; but if so, not even our relationship shall protect you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Peace, ungrateful and obstinate fool!&rsquo; said Redgauntlet. Yet stay&mdash;will
      you be satisfied if you see this Alan Fairford, the bundle of bombazine&mdash;this
      precious friend of yours&mdash;well and sound? Will you, I say, be
      satisfied with seeing him in perfect safety without attempting to speak to
      or converse with him?&rsquo; Darsie signified his assent. &lsquo;Take hold of my arm,
      then,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet; &lsquo;and do you, niece Lilias, take the other; and
      beware; Sir Arthur, how you bear yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Darsie was compelled to acquiesce, sufficiently aware that his uncle would
      permit him no interview with a friend whose influence would certainly be
      used against his present earnest wishes, and in some measure contented
      with the assurance of Fairford&rsquo;s personal safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Redgauntlet led them through one or two passages (for the house, as we
      have before said, was very irregular, and built at different times) until
      they entered an apartment, where a man with shouldered carabine kept watch
      at the door, but readily turned the key for their reception. In this room
      they found Alan Fairford and the Quaker, apparently in deep conversation
      with each other. They looked up as Redgauntlet and his party entered; and
      Alan pulled off his hat and made a profound reverence, which the young
      lady, who recognized him,&mdash;though, masked as she was, he could not
      know her,&mdash;returned with some embarrassment, arising probably from
      the recollection of the bold step she had taken in visiting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darsie longed to speak, but dared not. His uncle only said, &lsquo;Gentlemen, I
      know you are as anxious on Mr. Darsie Latimer&rsquo;s account as he is upon
      yours. I am commissioned by him to inform you, that he is as well as you
      are&mdash;I trust you will all meet soon. Meantime, although I cannot
      suffer you to be at large, you shall be as well treated as is possible
      under your temporary confinement.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed on, without pausing to hear the answers which the lawyer and the
      Quaker were hastening to prefer; and only waving his hand by way of adieu,
      made his exit, with the real and the seeming lady whom he had under his
      charge, through a door at the upper end of the apartment, which was
      fastened and guarded like that by which they entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Redgauntlet next led the way into a very small room; adjoining which, but
      divided by a partition, was one of apparently larger dimensions; for they
      heard the trampling of the heavy boots of the period, as if several
      persons were walking to and fro and conversing in low and anxious
      whispers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet to his nephew, as he disencumbered him from the
      riding-skirt and the mask, &lsquo;I restore you to yourself, and trust you will
      lay aside all effeminate thoughts with this feminine dress. Do not blush
      at having worn a disguise to which kings and heroes have been reduced. It
      is when female craft or female cowardice find their way into a manly
      bosom, that he who entertains these sentiments should take eternal shame
      to himself for thus having resembled womankind. Follow me, while Lilias
      remains here. I will introduce you to those whom I hope to see associated
      with you in the most glorious cause that hand ever drew sword in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Darsie paused. &lsquo;Uncle,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;my person is in your hands; but
      remember, my will is my own. I will not be hurried into any resolution of
      importance. Remember what I have already said&mdash;what I now repeat&mdash;that
      I will take no step of importance but upon conviction.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But canst thou be convinced, thou foolish boy, without hearing and
      understanding the grounds on which we act?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying he took Darsie by the arm, and walked with him to the next room&mdash;a
      large apartment, partly filled with miscellaneous articles of commerce,
      chiefly connected with contraband trade; where, among bales and barrels,
      sat, or walked to and fro, several gentlemen, whose manners and looks
      seemed superior to the plain riding dresses which they wore.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a grave and stern anxiety upon their countenances, when, on
      Redgauntlet&rsquo;s entrance, they drew from their separate coteries into one
      group around him, and saluted him with a formality which had something in
      it of ominous melancholy. As Darsie looked around the circle, he thought
      he could discern in it few traces of that adventurous hope which urges men
      upon desperate enterprises; and began to believe that the conspiracy would
      dissolve of itself, without the necessity of his placing himself in direct
      opposition to so violent a character as his uncle, and incurring the
      hazard with which such opposition must be attended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Redgauntlet, however, did not, or would not, see any such marks of
      depression of spirit amongst his coadjutors, but met them with cheerful
      countenance, and a warm greeting of welcome. &lsquo;Happy to meet you here, my
      lord,&rsquo; he said, bowing low to a slender young man. &lsquo;I trust you come with
      the pledges of your noble father, of B&mdash;, and all that loyal house.&mdash;Sir
      Richard, what news in the west? I am told you had two hundred men on foot
      to have joined when the fatal retreat from Derby was commenced. When the
      White Standard is again displayed, it shall not be turned back so easily,
      either by the force of its enemies, or the falsehood of its friends.&mdash;Doctor
      Grumball, I bow to the representative of Oxford, the mother of learning
      and loyalty.&mdash;Pengwinion, you Cornish chough, has this good wind
      blown you north?&mdash;Ah, my brave Cambro-Britons, when was Wales last in
      the race of honour?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Such and such-like compliments he dealt around, which were in general
      answered by silent bows; but when he saluted one of his own countrymen by
      the name of MacKellar, and greeted Maxwell of Summertrees by that of
      Pate-in-Peril, the latter replied, &lsquo;that if Pate were not a fool, he would
      be Pate-in-Safety;&rsquo; and the former, a thin old gentle-man, in tarnished
      embroidery, said bluntly, &lsquo;Aye, troth, Redgauntlet, I am here just like
      yourself; I have little to lose&mdash;they that took my land the last
      time, may take my life this; and that is all I care about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The English gentlemen, who were still in possession of their paternal
      estates, looked doubtfully on each other, and there was something
      whispered among them of the fox which had lost his tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Redgauntlet hastened to address them. &lsquo;I think, my lords and gentlemen,&rsquo; 
      he said, &lsquo;that I can account for something like sadness which has crept
      upon an assembly gathered together for so noble a purpose. Our numbers
      seem, when thus assembled, too small and inconsiderable to shake the
      firm-seated usurpation of a half-century. But do not count us by what we
      are in thew and muscle, but by what our summons can do among our
      countrymen. In this small party are those who have power to raise
      battalions, and those who have wealth to pay them. And do not believe our
      friends who are absent are cold or indifferent to the cause. Let us once
      light the signal, and it will be hailed by all who retain love for the
      Stuart, and by all&mdash;a more numerous body&mdash;who hate the Elector.
      Here I have letters from&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Richard Glendale interrupted the speaker. &lsquo;We all confide,
      Redgauntlet, in your valour and skill&mdash;we admire your perseverance;
      and probably nothing short of your strenuous exertions, and the emulation
      awakened by your noble and disinterested conduct, could have brought so
      many of us, the scattered remnant of a disheartened party, to meet
      together once again in solemn consultation; for I take it, gentlemen,&rsquo; he
      said, looking round, &lsquo;this is only a consultation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing more,&rsquo; said the young lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing more,&rsquo; said Doctor Grumball, shaking his large academical peruke.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, &lsquo;Only a consultation,&rsquo; was echoed by the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Redgauntlet bit his lip. &lsquo;I had hopes,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that the discourses I
      have held with most of you, from time to time, had ripened into more
      maturity than your words imply, and that we were here to execute as well
      as to deliberate; and for this we stand prepared. I can raise five hundred
      men with my whistle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Five hundred men!&rsquo; said one of the Welsh squires; &lsquo;Cot bless us! and pray
      you, what cood could five hundred men do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All that the priming does for the cannon, Mr. Meredith,&rsquo; answered
      Redgauntlet; &lsquo;it will enable us to seize Carlisle, and you know what our
      friends have engaged for in that case.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes&mdash;but,&rsquo; said the young nobleman, &lsquo;you must not hurry us on too
      fast, Mr. Redgauntlet; we are all, I believe, as sincere and truehearted
      in this business as you are, but we will not be driven forward blindfold.
      We owe caution to ourselves and our families, as well as to those whom we
      are empowered to represent on this occasion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who hurries you, my lord? Who is it that would drive this meeting forward
      blindfold? I do not understand your lordship,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said Sir Richard Glendale, &lsquo;at least do not let us fall under our
      old reproach of disagreeing among ourselves. What my lord means,
      Redgauntlet, is, that we have this morning heard it is uncertain whether
      you could even bring that body of men whom you count upon; your
      countryman, Mr. MacKellar, seemed, just before you came in, to doubt
      whether your people would rise in any force, unless you could produce the
      authority of your nephew.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I might ask,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet,&rsquo; what right MacKellar, or any one, has to
      doubt my being able to accomplish what I stand pledged for? But our hopes
      consist in our unity. Here stands my nephew. Gentlemen, I present to you
      my kinsman, Sir Arthur Darsie Redgauntlet of that Ilk.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gentlemen,&rsquo; said Darsie, with a throbbing bosom, for he felt the crisis a
      very painful one, &lsquo;Allow me to say, that I suspend expressing my
      sentiments on the important subject under discussion until I have heard
      those of the present meeting.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Proceed in your deliberations, gentlemen,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet; &lsquo;I will show
      my nephew such reasons for acquiescing in the result, as will entirely
      remove any scruples which may hang around his mind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Grumball now coughed, &lsquo;shook his ambrosial curls,&rsquo; and addressed the
      assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The principles of Oxford,&rsquo; he said,&rsquo; are well understood, since she was
      the last to resign herself to the Arch-Usurper,&mdash;since she has
      condemned, by her sovereign authority, the blasphemous, atheistical, and
      anarchical tenets of Locke, and other deluders of the public mind. Oxford
      will give men, money and countenance, to the cause of the rightful
      monarch. But we have, been often deluded by foreign powers, who have
      availed themselves of our zeal to stir up civil dissensions, in Britain,
      not for the advantage of our blessed though banished monarch, but to stir
      up disturbances by which they might profit, while we, their tools, are
      sure to be ruined. Oxford, therefore, will not rise, unless our sovereign
      comes in person to claim our allegiance, in which case, God forbid we
      should refuse him our best obedience.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is a very cood advice,&rsquo; said Mr. Meredith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In troth,&rsquo; said Sir Richard Glendale, &lsquo;it is the very keystone of our
      enterprise, and the only condition upon which I myself and others could
      ever have dreamt of taking up arms. No insurrection which has not Charles
      Edward himself at its head, will, ever last longer than till a single foot
      company of redcoats march to disperse it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is my own opinion, and that of all my family,&rsquo; said the young
      nobleman already mentioned; &lsquo;and I own I am somewhat surprised at being
      summoned to attend a dangerous rendezvous such as this, before something
      certain could have been stated to us on this most important preliminary
      point.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pardon me, my lord,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet; &lsquo;I have not been so unjust either
      to myself or my friends&mdash;I had no means of communicating to our
      distant confederates (without the greatest risk of discovery) what is
      known to some of my honourable friends. As courageous, and as resolved, as
      when, twenty years since, he threw himself into the wilds of Moidart,
      Charles Edward has instantly complied with the wishes of his faithful
      subjects. Charles Edward is in this country&mdash;Charles Edward is in
      this house!&mdash;Charles Edward waits but your present decision, to
      receive the homage of those who have ever called themselves his loyal
      liegemen. He that would now turn his coat, and change his note, must do so
      under the eye of his sovereign.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a deep pause. Those among the conspirators whom mere habit, or a
      desire of preserving consistency, had engaged in the affair, now saw with
      terror their retreat cut off; and others, who at a distance had regarded
      the proposed enterprise as hopeful, trembled when the moment of actually
      embarking in it was thus unexpectedly and almost inevitably precipitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How now, my lords and gentlemen!&rsquo; said Redgauntlet; is it delight and
      rapture that keep you thus silent? where are the eager welcomes that
      should be paid to your rightful king, who a second time confides his
      person to the care of his subjects, undeterred by the hairbreadth escapes
      and severe privations of his former expedition? I hope there is no
      gentleman here that is not ready to redeem, in his prince&rsquo;s presence, the
      pledge of fidelity which he offered in his absence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I, at least,&rsquo; said the young nobleman resolutely, and laying his hand on
      his sword, &lsquo;will not be that coward. If Charles is come to these shores, I
      will be the first to give him welcome, and to devote my life and fortune
      to his service.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Before Cot,&rsquo; said Mr. Meredith, &lsquo;I do not see that Mr. Redgauntlet has
      left us anything else to do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay,&rsquo; said Summertrees, &lsquo;there is yet one other question. Has he brought
      any of those Irish rapparees with him, who broke the neck of our last
      glorious affair?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a man of them,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I trust,&rsquo; said Dr. Grumball, &lsquo;that there are no Catholic priests in his
      company. I would not intrude on the private conscience of my sovereign,
      but, as an unworthy son of the Church of England, it is my duty to
      consider her security.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a Popish dog or cat is there, to bark or mew about his Majesty,&rsquo; said
      Redgauntlet. &lsquo;Old Shaftesbury himself could not wish a prince&rsquo;s person
      more secure from Popery&mdash;which may not be the worst religion in the
      world, notwithstanding. Any more doubts, gentlemen? can no more plausible
      reasons be discovered for postponing the payment of our duty, and
      discharge of our oaths and engagements? Meantime your king waits your
      declaration&mdash;by my faith he hath but a frozen reception!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Redgauntlet,&rsquo; said Sir Richard Glendale, calmly, &lsquo;your reproaches shall
      not goad me into anything of which my reason disapproves. That I respect
      my engagement as much as you do, is evident, since I am here, ready to
      support it with the best blood in my veins. But has the king really come
      hither entirely unattended?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has no man with him but young &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, as aide de camp,
      and a single valet de chambre.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No MAN&mdash;but, Redgauntlet, as you are a gentleman, has he no woman
      with him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Redgauntlet cast his eyes on the ground and replied, &lsquo;I am sorry to say&mdash;he
      has.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The company looked at each other, and remained silent for a moment. At
      length Sir Richard proceeded. &lsquo;I need not repeat to you, Mr. Redgauntlet,
      what is the well-grounded opinion of his Majesty&rsquo;s friends concerning that
      most unhappy connexion there is but one sense and feeling amongst us upon
      the subject. I must conclude that our humble remonstrances were
      communicated by you, sir, to the king?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the same strong terms in which they were couched,&rsquo; replied
      Redgauntlet. &lsquo;I love his Majesty&rsquo;s cause more than I fear his
      displeasure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, apparently, our humble expostulation has produced no effect. This
      lady, who has crept into his bosom, has a sister in the Elector of
      Hanover&rsquo;s court, and yet we are well assured that our most private
      communication is placed in her keeping.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;VARIUM ET MUTABILE SEMPER FEMINA,&rsquo; said Dr. Grumball.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She puts his secrets into her work-bag,&rsquo; said Maxwell; &lsquo;and out they fly
      whenever she opens it. If I must hang, I would wish it to be in somewhat a
      better rope than the string of a lady&rsquo;s hussey.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you, too, turning dastard, Maxwell?&rsquo; said Redgauntlet, in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not I,&rsquo; said Maxwell; &lsquo;let us fight for it, and let them win and wear us;
      but to be betrayed by a brimstone like that&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be temperate, gentlemen,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet; &lsquo;the foible of which you
      complain so heavily has always been that of kings and heroes; which I feel
      strongly confident the king will surmount, upon the humble entreaty of his
      best servants, and when he sees them ready to peril their all in his
      cause, upon the slight condition of his resigning the society of a female
      favourite, of whom I have seen reason to think he hath been himself for
      some time wearied. But let us not press upon him rashly with our
      well-meant zeal. He has a princely will as becomes his princely birth, and
      we, gentlemen, who are royalists, should be the last to take advantage of
      circumstances to limit its exercise. I am as much surprised and hurt as
      you can be, to find that he has made her the companion of this journey,
      increasing every chance of treachery and detection. But do not let us
      insist upon a sacrifice so humiliating, while he has scarce placed a foot
      upon the beach of his kingdom. Let us act generously by our sovereign; and
      when we have shown what we will do for him, we shall be able, with better
      face, to state what it is we expect him to concede.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed, I think it is but a pity,&rsquo; said MacKellar, &lsquo;when so many pretty
      gentlemen are got together, that they should part without the flash of a
      sword among them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should be of that gentleman&rsquo;s opinion,&rsquo; said Lord &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      &lsquo;had I nothing to lose but my life; but I frankly own, that the conditions
      on which our family agreed to join having been, in this instance, left
      unfulfilled, I will not peril the whole fortunes of our house on the
      doubtful fidelity of an artful woman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sorry to see your lordship,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet, &lsquo;take a course which
      is more likely to secure your house&rsquo;s wealth than to augment its honours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How am I to understand your language, sir?&rsquo; said the young nobleman,
      haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, gentlemen,&rsquo; said Dr Grumball, interposing, &lsquo;do not let friends
      quarrel; we are all zealous for the cause&mdash;but truly, although I know
      the license claimed by the great in such matters, and can, I hope, make
      due allowance, there is, I may say, an indecorum in a prince who comes to
      claim the allegiance of the Church of England, arriving on such an errand
      with such a companion&mdash;SI NON CASTE, CAUTE TAMEN.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder how the Church of England came to be so heartily attached to his
      merry old namesake,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Richard Glendale then took up the question, as one whose authority and
      experience gave him right to speak with much weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have no leisure for hesitation,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;it is full time that we
      decide what course we are to hold. I feel as much as you, Mr. Redgauntlet,
      the delicacy of capitulating with our sovereign in his present condition.
      But I must also think of the total ruin of the cause, the confiscation and
      bloodshed which will take place among his adherents, and all through the
      infatuation with which he adheres to a woman who is the pensionary of the
      present minister, as she was for years Sir Robert Walpole&rsquo;s. Let his
      Majesty send her back to the continent, and the sword on which I now lay
      my hand shall instantly be unsheathed, and, I trust, many hundred others
      at the same moment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The other persons present testified their unanimous acquiescence in what
      Sir Richard Glendale had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see you have taken your resolutions, gentlemen,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet;
      &lsquo;unwisely I think, because I believe that, by softer and more generous
      proceedings, you would have been more likely to carry a point which I
      think as desirable as you do. But what is to be done if Charles should
      refuse, with the inflexibility of his grandfather, to comply with this
      request of yours? Do you mean to abandon him to his fate?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God forbid!&rsquo; said Sir Richard, hastily; &lsquo;and God forgive you, Mr.
      Redgauntlet, for breathing such a thought. No! I for one will, with all
      duty and humility, see him safe back to his vessel, and defend him with my
      life against whosoever shall assail him. But when I have seen his sails
      spread, my next act will be to secure, if I can, my own safety, by
      retiring to my house; or, if I find our engagement, as is too probable,
      has taken wind, by surrendering myself to the next Justice of Peace, and
      giving security that hereafter I shall live quiet, and submit to the
      ruling powers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the rest of the persons present intimated their agreement in opinion
      with the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, gentlemen,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet, &lsquo;it is not for me to oppose the
      opinion of every one; and I must do you the justice to say, that the king
      has, in the present instance, neglected a condition of your agreement
      which was laid before him in very distinct terms. The question now is, who
      is to acquaint him with the result of this conference; for I presume you
      would not wait on him in a body to make the proposal that he should
      dismiss a person from his family as the price of your allegiance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think Mr. Redgauntlet should make the explanation, said Lord&mdash;.
      &lsquo;As he has, doubtless, done justice to our remonstrances by communicating
      them to the king, no one can, with such propriety and force, state the
      natural and inevitable consequence of their being neglected.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, I think,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet, &lsquo;that those who make the objection
      should state it, for I am confident the king will hardly believe, on less
      authority than that of the heir of the loyal House of B&mdash;, that he is
      the first to seek an evasion of his pledge to join him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An evasion, sir!&rsquo; repeated Lord &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, fiercely, &lsquo;I have
      borne too much from you already, and this I will not endure. Favour me
      with your company to the downs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Redgauntlet laughed scornfully, and was about to follow the fiery young
      man, when Sir Richard again interposed. &lsquo;Are we to exhibit,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;the
      last symptoms of the dissolution of our party, by turning our swords
      against each other? Be patient, Lord &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;; in such
      conferences as this, much must pass unquestioned which might brook
      challenge elsewhere. There is a privilege of party as of parliament&mdash;men
      cannot, in emergency, stand upon picking phrases. Gentlemen, if you will
      extend your confidence in me so far, I will wait upon his Majesty, and I
      hope my Lord &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; and Mr. Redgauntlet will accompany me.
      I trust the explanation of this unpleasant matter will prove entirely
      satisfactory, and that we shall find ourselves at liberty to render our
      homage to our sovereign without reserve, when I for one will be the first
      to peril all in his just quarrel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Redgauntlet at once stepped forward. &lsquo;My lord,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;if my zeal made
      me say anything in the slightest degree offensive, I wish it unsaid, and
      ask your pardon. A gentleman can do no more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could not have asked Mr. Redgauntlet to do so much,&rsquo; said the young
      nobleman, willingly accepting the hand which Redgauntlet offered. &lsquo;I know
      no man living from whom I could take so much reproof without a sense of
      degradation as from himself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me then hope, my lord, that you will go with Sir Richard and me to
      the presence. Your warm blood will heat our zeal&mdash;our colder resolves
      will temper yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lord smiled, and shook his head. &lsquo;Alas! Mr. Redgauntlet,&rsquo; he
      said, &lsquo;I am ashamed to say, that in zeal you surpass us all. But I will
      not refuse this mission, provided you will permit Sir Arthur, your nephew,
      also to accompany us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My nephew?&rsquo; said Redgauntlet, and seemed to hesitate, then added, &lsquo;Most
      certainly. I trust,&rsquo; he said, looking at Darsie, &lsquo;he will bring to his
      prince&rsquo;s presence such sentiments as fit the occasion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed however to Darsie, that his uncle would rather have left him
      behind, had he not feared that he might in that case have been influenced
      by, or might perhaps himself influence, the unresolved confederates with
      whom he must have associated during his absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will go,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet, &lsquo;and request admission.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment after he returned, and without speaking, motioned for the
      young nobleman to advance. He did so, followed by Sir Richard Glendale and
      Darsie, Redgauntlet himself bringing up the rear. A short passage, and a
      few steps, brought them to the door of the temporary presence-chamber, in
      which the Royal Wanderer was to receive their homage. It was the upper
      loft of one of those cottages which made additions to the old inn, poorly
      furnished, dusty, and in disorder; for, rash as the enterprise might be
      considered, they had been still careful not to draw the attention of
      strangers by any particular attentions to the personal accommodation of
      the prince. He was seated, when the deputies, as they might be termed, of
      his remaining adherents entered; and as he rose, and came forward and
      bowed, in acceptance of their salutation, it was with a dignified courtesy
      which at once supplied whatever was deficient in external pomp, and
      converted the wretched garret into a saloon worthy of the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is needless to add that he was the same personage already introduced in
      the character of Father Buonaventure, by which name he was distinguished
      at Fairladies. His dress was not different from what he then wore,
      excepting that he had a loose riding-coat of camlet, under which he
      carried an efficient cut-and-thrust sword, instead of his walking rapier,
      and also a pair of pistols.
    </p>
    <p>
      Redgauntlet presented to him successively the young Lord &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      and his kinsman, Sir Arthur Darsie Redgauntlet, who trembled as, bowing
      and kissing his hand, he found himself surprised into what might be
      construed an act of high treason, which yet he saw no safe means to avoid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Richard Glendale seemed personally known to Charles Edward, who
      received him with a mixture of dignity and affection, and seemed to
      sympathize with the tears which rushed into that gentleman&rsquo;s eyes as he
      bade his Majesty welcome to his native kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, my good Sir Richard,&rsquo; said the unfortunate prince in a tone
      melancholy, yet resolved, &lsquo;Charles Edward is with his faithful friends
      once more&mdash;not, perhaps, with his former gay hopes which undervalued
      danger, but with the same determined contempt of the worst which can
      befall him, in claiming his own rights and those of his country.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I rejoice, sire&mdash;and yet, alas! I must also grieve, to see you once
      more on the British shores,&rsquo; said Sir Richard Glendale, and stopped short&mdash;a
      tumult of contradictory feelings preventing his further utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is the call of my faithful and suffering people which alone could have
      induced me to take once more the sword in my hand. For my own part, Sir
      Richard, when I have reflected how many of my loyal and devoted friends
      perished by the sword and by proscription, or died indigent and neglected
      in a foreign land, I have often, sworn that no view to my personal
      aggrandizement should again induce me to agitate a title which has cost my
      followers so dear. But since so many men of worth and honour conceive the
      cause of England and Scotland to be linked with that of Charles Stuart, I
      must follow their brave example, and, laying aside all other
      considerations, once more stand forward as their deliverer. I am, however,
      come hither upon your invitation; and as you are so completely acquainted
      with circumstances to which my absence must necessarily have rendered me a
      stranger, I must be a mere tool in the hands of my friends. I know well I
      never can refer myself implicitly to more loyal hearts or wiser heads,
      than Herries Redgauntlet, and Sir Richard Glendale. Give me your advice,
      then, how we are to proceed, and decide upon the fate of Charles Edward.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Redgauntlet looked at Sir Richard, as if to say, &lsquo;Can you press any
      additional or unpleasant condition at a moment like this?&rsquo; And the other
      shook his head and looked down, as if his resolution was unaltered, and
      yet as feeling all the delicacy of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence, which was broken by the unfortunate representative of
      an unhappy dynasty, with some appearance of irritation. &lsquo;This is strange,
      gentlemen,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;you have sent for me from the bosom of my family, to
      head an adventure of doubt and danger; and when I come, your own minds
      seem to be still irresolute. I had not expected this on the part of two
      such men.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For me, sire,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet, &lsquo;the steel of my sword is not truer than
      the temper of my mind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My Lord &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s and mine are equally so,&rsquo; said Sir
      Richard; &lsquo;but you had in charge, Mr. Redgauntlet, to convey our request to
      his Majesty, coupled with certain conditions.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I discharged my duty to his Majesty and to you,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I looked at no condition, gentlemen,&rsquo; said their king, with dignity,&rsquo; 
      save that which called me here to assert my rights in person. That I have
      fulfilled at no common risk. Here I stand to keep my word, and I expect of
      you to be true to yours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There was, or should have been, something more than that in our proposal,
      please your Majesty,&rsquo; said Sir Richard. &lsquo;There was a condition annexed to
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I saw it not,&rsquo; said Charles, interrupting him. &lsquo;Out of tenderness towards
      the noble hearts of whom I think so highly, I would neither see nor read
      anything which could lessen them in my love and my esteem. Conditions can
      have no part betwixt prince and subject.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sire,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet, kneeling on one knee, &lsquo;I see from Sir Richard&rsquo;s
      countenance he deems it my fault that your Majesty seems ignorant of what
      your subjects desired that I should communicate to your Majesty. For
      Heaven&rsquo;s sake! for the sake of all my past services and sufferings, leave
      not such a stain upon my honour! The note, Number D, of which this is a
      copy, referred to the painful subject to which Sir Richard again directs
      your attention.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You press upon me, gentlemen,&rsquo; said the prince, colouring highly,&rsquo; 
      recollections, which, as I hold them most alien to your character, I would
      willingly have banished from my memory. I did not suppose that my loyal
      subjects would think so poorly of me, as to use my depressed circumstances
      as a reason for forcing themselves into my domestic privacies, and
      stipulating arrangements with their king regarding matters in which the
      meanest minds claim the privilege of thinking for themselves. In affairs
      of state and public policy, I will ever be guided as becomes a prince, by
      the advice of my wisest counsellors; in those which regard my private
      affections and my domestic arrangements, I claim the same freedom of will
      which I allow to all my subjects, and without which a crown were less
      worth wearing than a beggar&rsquo;s bonnet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May it please your Majesty,&rsquo; said Sir Richard Glendale, &lsquo;I see it must be
      my lot to speak unwilling truths; but believe me, I do so with as much
      profound respect as deep regret. It is true, we have called you to head a
      mighty undertaking, and that your Majesty, preferring honour to safety,
      and the love of your country to your own ease, has condescended to become
      our leader. But we also pointed out as a necessary and indispensable
      preparatory step to the achievement of our purpose&mdash;and, I must say,
      as a positive condition of our engaging in it&mdash;that an individual,
      supposed,&mdash;I presume not to guess how truly,&mdash;to have your
      Majesty&rsquo;s more intimate confidence, and believed, I will not say on
      absolute proof but upon the most pregnant suspicion, to be capable of
      betraying that confidence to the Elector of Hanover, should be removed
      from your royal household and society.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is too insolent, Sir Richard!&rsquo; said Charles Edward. &lsquo;Have you
      inveigled me into your power to bait me in this unseemly manner? And you,
      Redgauntlet, why did you suffer matters to come to such a point as this,
      without making me more distinctly aware what insults were to be practised
      on me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My gracious prince,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet, &lsquo;I am so far to blame in this,
      that I did not think so slight an impediment as that of a woman&rsquo;s society
      could have really interrupted an undertaking of this magnitude. I am a
      plain man, sire, and speak but bluntly; I could not have dreamt but what,
      within the first five minutes of this interview, either Sir Richard and
      his friends would have ceased to insist upon a condition so ungrateful to
      your Majesty, or that your Majesty would have sacrificed this unhappy
      attachment to the sound advice, or even to the over-anxious suspicions, of
      so many faithful subjects. I saw no entanglement in such a difficulty
      which on either side might not have been broken through like a cobweb.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You were mistaken, sir,&rsquo; said Charles Edward, &lsquo;entirely mistaken&mdash;as
      much so as you are at this moment, when you think in your heart my refusal
      to comply with this insolent proposition is dictated by a childish and
      romantic passion for an individual, I tell you, sir, I could part with
      that person to-morrow, without an instant&rsquo;s regret&mdash;that I have had
      thoughts of dismissing her from my court, for reasons known to myself; but
      that I will never betray my rights as a sovereign and a man, by taking
      this step to secure the favour of any one, or to purchase that allegiance
      which, if you owe it to me at all, is due to me as my birthright.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sorry for this,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet; &lsquo;I hope both your Majesty and Sir
      Richard will reconsider your resolutions, or forbear this discussion, in a
      conjuncture so pressing. I trust your Majesty will recollect that you are
      on hostile ground; that our preparations cannot have so far escaped notice
      as to permit us now with safety to retreat from our purpose; insomuch,
      that it is with the deepest anxiety of heart I foresee even danger to your
      own royal person, unless you can generously give your subjects the
      satisfaction, which Sir Richard seems to think they are obstinate in
      demanding.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And deep indeed your anxiety ought to be,&rsquo; said the prince. &lsquo;Is it in
      these circumstances of personal danger in which you expect to overcome a
      resolution, which is founded on a sense of what is due to me as a man or a
      prince? If the axe and scaffold were ready before the windows of
      Whitehall, I would rather tread the same path with my great-grandfather,
      than concede the slightest point in which my honour is concerned.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke these words with a determined accent, and looked around him on
      the company, all of whom (excepting Darsie, who saw, he thought, a fair
      period to a most perilous enterprise) seemed in deep anxiety and
      confusion. At length, Sir Richard spoke in a solemn and melancholy tone.
      &lsquo;If the safety,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;of poor Richard Glendale were alone concerned
      in this matter, I have never valued my life enough to weigh it against the
      slightest point of your Majesty&rsquo;s service. But I am only a messenger&mdash;a
      commissioner, who must execute my trust, and upon whom a thousand voices
      will cry, Curse and woe, if I do it not with fidelity. All of your
      adherents, even Redgauntlet himself, see certain ruin to this enterprise&mdash;the
      greatest danger to your Majesty&rsquo;s person&mdash;the utter destruction of
      all your party and friends, if they insist not on the point, which,
      unfortunately, your Majesty is so unwilling to concede. I speak it with a
      heart full of anguish&mdash;with a tongue unable to utter my emotions&mdash;but
      it must be spoken&mdash;the fatal truth&mdash;that if your royal goodness
      cannot yield to us a boon which we hold necessary to our security and your
      own, your Majesty with one word disarms ten thousand men, ready to draw
      their swords in your behalf; or, to speak yet more plainly, you annihilate
      even the semblance of a royal party in Great Britain.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And why do you not add,&rsquo; said the prince, scornfully, &lsquo;that the men who
      have been ready to assume arms in my behalf, will atone for their treason
      to the Elector, by delivering me up to the fate for which so many
      proclamations have destined me? Carry my head to St. James&rsquo;s, gentlemen;
      you will do a more acceptable and a more honourable action, than, having
      inveigled me into a situation which places me so completely in your power,
      to dishonour yourselves by propositions which dishonour me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My God, sire!&rsquo; exclaimed Sir Richard, clasping his hands together, in
      impatience, &lsquo;of what great and inexpiable crime can your Majesty&rsquo;s
      ancestors have &lsquo;been guilty, that they have been punished by the
      infliction of judicial blindness on their whole generation!&mdash;Come, my
      Lord &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, we must to our friends.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By your leave, Sir Richard,&rsquo; said the young nobleman, &lsquo;not till we, have
      learned what measures can be taken for his Majesty&rsquo;s personal safety.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Care not for me, young man,&rsquo; said Charles Edward; &lsquo;when I was in the
      society of Highland robbers and cattle-drovers, I was safer than I now
      hold myself among the representatives of the best blood in England.
      Farewell, gentlemen&mdash;I will shift for myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This must never be,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet. &lsquo;Let me that brought you to the
      point of danger, at least provide for your safe retreat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he hastily left the apartment, followed by his nephew. The
      Wanderer, averting his eyes from Lord &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; and Sir
      Richard Glendale, threw himself into a seat at the upper end of the
      apartment, while they, in much anxiety, stood together, at a distance from
      him, and conversed in whispers.

      CHAPTER XXIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      NARRATIVE CONTINUED
    </h3>
    <p>
      When Redgauntlet left the room, in haste and discomposure, the first
      person he met on the stair, and indeed so close by the door of the
      apartment that Darsie thought he must have been listening there, was his
      attendant Nixon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What the devil do you here?&rsquo; he said, abruptly and sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wait your orders,&rsquo; said Nixon. &lsquo;I hope all&rsquo;s right!&mdash;excuse my
      zeal.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All is wrong, sir. Where is the seafaring fellow&mdash;Ewart&mdash;what
      do you call him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nanty Ewart, sir. I will carry your commands,&rsquo; said Nixon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will deliver them myself to him,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet; call him hither.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But should your honour leave the presence?&rsquo; said Nixon, still lingering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&lsquo;Sdeath, sir, do you prate to me?&rsquo; said Redgauntlet, bending his brows.
      &lsquo;I, sir, transact my own business; you, I am told, act by a ragged
      deputy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Without further answer, Nixon departed, rather disconcerted, as it seemed
      to Darsie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That dog turns insolent and lazy,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet; but I must bear with
      him for a while.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment after, Nixon returned with Ewart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is this the smuggling fellow?&rsquo; demanded Redgauntlet. Nixon nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he sober now? he was brawling anon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sober enough for business,&rsquo; said Nixon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well then, hark ye, Ewart;&mdash;man your boat with your best hands, and
      have her by the pier&mdash;get your other fellows on board the brig&mdash;if
      you have any cargo left, throw it overboard; it shall be all paid, five
      times over&mdash;and be ready for a start to Wales or the Hebrides, or
      perhaps for Sweden or Norway.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ewart answered sullenly enough, &lsquo;Aye, aye, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go with him, Nixon,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet, forcing himself to speak with some
      appearance of cordiality to the servant with whom he was offended; &lsquo;see he
      does his duty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ewart left the house sullenly, followed by Nixon. The sailor was just in
      that species of drunken humour which made him jealous, passionate, and
      troublesome, without showing any other disorder than that of irritability.
      As he walked towards the beach he kept muttering to himself, but in such a
      tone that his companion lost not a word, &lsquo;Smuggling fellow&mdash;Aye,
      smuggler&mdash;and, start your cargo into the sea&mdash;and be ready to
      start for the Hebrides, or Sweden&mdash;or the devil, I suppose. Well, and
      what if I said in answer&mdash;Rebel, Jacobite&mdash;traitor; I&rsquo;ll make
      you and your d&mdash;&mdash;d confederates walk the plank&mdash;I have
      seen better men do it&mdash;half a score of a morning&mdash;when I was
      across the Line.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;D&mdash;d unhandsome terms those Redgauntlet used to you, brother.&rsquo; said
      Nixon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which do you mean?&rsquo; said Ewart, starting, and recollecting himself. &lsquo;I
      have been at my old trade of thinking aloud, have I?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No matter,&rsquo; answered Nixon, &lsquo;none but a friend heard you. You cannot have
      forgotten how Redgauntlet disarmed you this morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, I would bear no malice about that&mdash;only he is so cursedly high
      and saucy,&rsquo; said Ewart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And then,&rsquo; said Nixon, &lsquo;I know you for a true-hearted Protestant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That I am, by G&mdash;,&rsquo; said Ewart. &lsquo;No, the Spaniards could never get
      my religion from me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And a friend to King George, and the Hanover line of succession,&rsquo; said
      Nixon, still walking and speaking very slow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may swear I am, excepting in the way of business, as Turnpenny says.
      I like King George, but I can&rsquo;t afford to pay duties.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are outlawed, I believe,&rsquo; said Nixon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Am I?&mdash;faith, I believe I am,&rsquo; said Ewart. &lsquo;I wish I were INLAWED
      again with all my heart. But come along, we must get all ready for our
      peremptory gentleman, I suppose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will teach you a better trick,&rsquo; said Nixon. &lsquo;There is a bloody pack of
      rebels yonder.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, we all know that,&rsquo; said the smuggler; &lsquo;but the snowball&rsquo;s melting, I
      think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is some one yonder, whose head is worth&mdash;thirty thousand&mdash;pounds&mdash;of
      sterling money,&rsquo; said Nixon, pausing between each word, as if to enforce
      the magnificence of the sum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what of that?&rsquo; said Ewart, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only that, instead of lying by the pier with your men on their oars, if
      you will just carry your boat on board just now, and take no notice of any
      signal from the shore, by G&mdash;d, Nanty Ewart. I will make a man of you
      for life!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh ho! then the Jacobite gentry are not so safe as they think
      themselves?&rsquo; said Nanty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In an hour or two,&rsquo; replied Nixon, &lsquo;they will be made safer in Carlisle
      Castle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The devil they will!&rsquo; said Ewart; &lsquo;and you have been the informer, I
      suppose?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; I have been ill paid for my service among the Redgauntlets&mdash;have
      scarce got dog&rsquo;s wages&mdash;and been treated worse than ever dog was
      used. I have the old fox and his cubs in the same trap now, Nanty; and
      we&rsquo;ll see how a certain young lady will look then. You see I am frank with
      you, Nanty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I will be as frank with you,&rsquo; said the smuggler. &lsquo;You are a d&mdash;d
      old scoundrel&mdash;traitor to the man whose bread you eat! Me help to
      betray poor devils, that have been so often betrayed myself! Not if they
      were a hundred Popes, Devils, and Pretenders. I will back and tell them
      their danger&mdash;they are part of cargo&mdash;regularly invoiced&mdash;put
      under my charge by the owners&mdash;I&rsquo;ll back&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are not stark mad?&rsquo; said Nixon, who now saw he had miscalculated in
      supposing Nanty&rsquo;s wild ideas of honour and fidelity could be shaken even
      by resentment, or by his Protestant partialities. &lsquo;You shall not go back&mdash;it
      is all a joke.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll back to Redgauntlet, and see whether it is a joke he will laugh at.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My life is lost if you do,&rsquo; said Nixon&mdash;&lsquo;hear reason.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They were in a clump or cluster of tall furze at the moment they were
      speaking, about half-way between the pier and the house, but not in a
      direct line, from which Nixon, whose object it was to gain time, had
      induced Ewart to diverge insensibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He now saw the necessity of taking a desperate resolution. &lsquo;Hear reason,&rsquo; 
      he said; and added, as Nanty still endeavoured to pass him, &lsquo;Or else hear
      this!&rsquo; discharging a pocket-pistol into the unfortunate man&rsquo;s body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nanty staggered, but kept his feet. &lsquo;It has cut my back-bone asunder,&rsquo; he
      said; &lsquo;you have done me the last good office, and I will not die
      ungrateful.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As he uttered the last words, he collected his remaining strength, stood
      firm for an instant, drew his hanger, and, fetching a stroke with both
      hands, cut Cristal Nixon down. The blow, struck with all the energy of a
      desperate and dying man, exhibited a force to which Ewart&rsquo;s exhausted
      frame might have seemed inadequate;&mdash;it cleft the hat which the
      wretch wore, though secured by a plate of iron within the lining, bit deep
      into his skull, and there left a fragment of the weapon, which was broke
      by the fury of the blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the seamen of the lugger, who strolled up attracted by the firing
      of the pistol, though being a small one the report was very trifling,
      found both the unfortunate men stark dead. Alarmed at what he saw, which
      he conceived to have been the consequence of some unsuccessful engagement
      betwixt his late commander and a revenue officer (for Nixon chanced not to
      be personally known to him) the sailor hastened back to the boat, in order
      to apprise his comrades of Nanty&rsquo;s fate, and to advise them to take off
      themselves and the vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Redgauntlet, having, as we have seen, dispatched Nixon for the
      purpose of securing a retreat for the unfortunate Charles, in case of
      extremity, returned to the apartment where he had left the Wanderer. He
      now found him alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir Richard Glendale,&rsquo; said the unfortunate prince, &lsquo;with his young
      friend, has gone to consult their adherents now in the house. Redgauntlet,
      my friend, I will not blame you for the circumstances in which I find
      myself, though I am at once placed in danger, and rendered contemptible.
      But you ought to have stated to me more strongly the weight which these
      gentlemen attached to their insolent proposition. You should have told me
      that no compromise would have any effect&mdash;that they desire not a
      prince to govern them, but one, on the contrary, over whom they were to
      exercise restraint on all occasions, from the highest affairs of the
      state, down to the most intimate and private concerns of his own privacy,
      which the most ordinary men desire to keep secret and sacred from
      interference.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God knows,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet, in much agitation, &lsquo;I acted for the best
      when I pressed your Majesty to come hither&mdash;I never thought that your
      Majesty, at such a crisis, would have scrupled, when a kingdom was in
      view, to sacrifice an attachment, which&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Peace, sir!&rsquo; said Charles; &lsquo;it is not for you to estimate my feelings
      upon such a subject.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Redgauntlet coloured high, and bowed profoundly. &lsquo;At least,&rsquo; he resumed,
      &lsquo;I hoped that some middle way might be found, and it shall&mdash;and must.&mdash;Come
      with me, nephew. We will to these gentlemen, and I am confident I will
      bring back heart-stirring tidings.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will do much to comply with them, Redgauntlet. I am loath, having again
      set my foot on British land, to quit it without a blow for my right. But
      this which they demand of me is a degradation, and compliance is
      impossible.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Redgauntlet, followed by his nephew, the unwilling spectator of this
      extraordinary scene, left once more the apartment of the adventurous
      Wanderer, and was met on the top of the stairs by Joe Crackenthorp. &lsquo;Where
      are the other gentlemen?&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yonder, in the west barrack,&rsquo; answered Joe; &lsquo;but Master Ingoldsby,&rsquo;&mdash;that
      was the name by which Redgauntlet was most generally known in Cumberland,&mdash;&lsquo;I
      wish to say to you that I must put yonder folk together in one room.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What folk?&rsquo; said Redgauntlet, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, them prisoner stranger folk, as you bid Cristal Nixon look after.
      Lord love you! this is a large house enow, but we cannot have separate
      lock-ups for folk, as they have in Newgate or in Bedlam. Yonder&rsquo;s a mad
      beggar, that is to be a great man when he wins a lawsuit, Lord help him!&mdash;Yonder&rsquo;s
      a Quaker and a lawyer charged with a riot; and, ecod, I must make one key
      and one lock keep them, for we are chokeful, and you have sent off old
      Nixon that could have given one some help in this confusion. Besides, they
      take up every one a room, and call for naughts on earth,&mdash;excepting
      the old man, who calls lustily enough,&mdash;but he has not a penny to pay
      shot.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do as thou wilt with them,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet, who had listened
      impatiently to his statement; &lsquo;so thou dost but keep them from getting out
      and making some alarm in the country, I care not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A Quaker and a lawyer!&rsquo; said Darsie. &lsquo;This must be Fairford and Geddes.&mdash;Uncle,
      I must request of you&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, nephew,&rsquo; interrupted Redgauntlet, &lsquo;this is no time for asking
      questions. You shall yourself decide upon their fate in the course of an
      hour&mdash;no harm whatever is designed them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he hurried towards the place where the Jacobite gentlemen were
      holding their council, and Darsie followed him, in the hope that the
      obstacle which had arisen to the prosecution of their desperate adventure
      would prove insurmountable and spare him the necessity of a dangerous and
      violent rupture with his uncle. The discussions among them were very
      eager; the more daring part of the conspirators, who had little but life
      to lose, being desirous to proceed at all hazards; while the others, whom
      a sense of honour and a hesitation to disavow long-cherished principles
      had brought forward, were perhaps not ill satisfied to have a fair apology
      for declining an adventure, into which they had entered with more of
      reluctance than zeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Joe Crackenthorp, availing himself of the hasty permission
      attained from Redgauntlet, proceeded to assemble in one apartment those
      whose safe custody had been thought necessary; and, without much
      considering the propriety of the matter, he selected for the common place
      of confinement, the room which Lilias had, since her brother&rsquo;s departure,
      occupied alone. It had a strong lock, and was double-hinged, which
      probably led to the preference assigned to it, as a place of security.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into this, Joe, with little ceremony, and a good deal of noise, introduced
      the Quaker and Fairford; the first descanting on the immorality, the other
      on the illegality, of his proceedings; and he turned a deaf ear both to
      the one and the other. Next he pushed in, almost in headlong fashion, the
      unfortunate litigant, who, having made some resistance at the threshold,
      had received a violent thrust in consequence, and came rushing forward,
      like a ram in the act of charging, with such impetus as must have carried
      him to the top of the room, and struck the cocked hat which sat perched on
      the top of his tow wig against Miss Redgauntlet&rsquo;s person, had not the
      honest Quaker interrupted his career by seizing him by the collar, and
      bringing him to a stand. &lsquo;Friend,&rsquo; said he, with the real good-breeding
      which so often subsists independently of ceremony, &lsquo;thou art no company
      for that young person; she is, thou seest, frightened at our being so
      suddenly thrust in hither; and although that be no fault of ours, yet it
      will become us to behave civilly towards her. Wherefore come thou with me
      to this window, and I will tell thee what it concerns thee to know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what for should I no speak to the Leddy, friend?&rsquo; said Peter, who was
      now about half seas over. &lsquo;I have spoke to leddies before now, man. What
      for should she be frightened at me? I am nae bogle, I ween. What are ye
      pooin&rsquo; me that gate for? Ye will rive my coat, and I will have a good
      action for having myself made SARTUM ATQUE TECTUM at your expenses.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding this threat, Mr. Geddes, whose muscles were as strong as
      his judgement was sound and his temper sedate, led Poor Peter under the
      sense of a control against which he could not struggle, to the farther
      corner of the apartment, where, placing him, whether he would or no, in a
      chair, he sat down beside him, and effectually prevented his annoying the
      young lady, upon whom he had seemed bent upon conferring the delights of
      his society.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Peter had immediately recognized his counsel learned in the law, it is
      probable that not even the benevolent efforts of the Quaker could have
      kept him in a state of restraint; but Fairford&rsquo;s back was turned towards
      his client, whose optics, besides being somewhat dazzled with ale and
      brandy, were speedily engaged in contemplating a half-crown which Joshua
      held between his finger and his thumb, saying, at the same time, &lsquo;Friend,
      thou art indigent and improvident. This will, well employed, procure thee
      sustentation of nature for more than a single day; and I will bestow it on
      thee if thou wilt sit here and keep me company; for neither thou nor I,
      friend, are fit company for ladies.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Speak for yourself, friend,&rsquo; said Peter, scornfully; &lsquo;I was ay kend to be
      agreeable to the fair sex; and when I was in business I served the ladies
      wi&rsquo; anither sort of decorum than Plainstanes, the d&mdash;d awkward
      scoundrel! It was one of the articles of dittay between us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, but, friend,&rsquo; said the Quaker, who observed that the young lady
      still seemed to fear Peter&rsquo;s intrusion, &lsquo;I wish to hear thee speak about
      this great lawsuit of thine, which has been matter of such celebrity.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Celebrity! Ye may swear that,&rsquo; said Peter, for the string was touched to
      which his crazy imagination always vibrated. &lsquo;And I dinna wonder that folk
      that judge things by their outward grandeur, should think me something
      worth their envying. It&rsquo;s very true that it is grandeur upon earth to hear
      ane&rsquo;s name thunnered out along the long-arched roof of the Outer House,&mdash;&ldquo;Poor
      Peter Peebles against Plainstanes ET PER CONTRA;&rdquo; a&rsquo; the best lawyers in
      the house fleeing like eagles to the prey; some because they are in the
      cause, and some because they want to be thought engaged (for there are
      tricks in other trades by selling muslins)&mdash;to see the reporters
      mending their pens to take down the debate&mdash;the Lords themselves
      pooin&rsquo; in their chairs, like folk sitting down to a gude dinner, and
      crying on the clerks for parts and pendicles of the process, who, puir
      bodies, can do little mair than cry on their closet-keepers to help them.
      To see a&rsquo; this,&rsquo; continued Peter, in a tone of sustained rapture, &lsquo;and to
      ken that naething will be said or dune amang a&rsquo; thae grand folk, for maybe
      the feck of three hours, saving what concerns you and your business&mdash;Oh,
      man, nae wonder that ye judge this to be earthly glory! And yet,
      neighbour, as I was saying, there be unco drawbacks&mdash;I whiles think
      of my bit house, where dinner, and supper, and breakfast, used to come
      without the crying for, just as if fairies had brought it&mdash;and the
      gude bed at e&rsquo;en&mdash;and the needfu&rsquo; penny in the pouch. And then to see
      a&rsquo; ane&rsquo;s warldly substance capering in the air in a pair of weighbauks,
      now up, now down, as the breath of judge or counsel inclines it for
      pursuer or defender,&mdash;troth, man, there are times I rue having ever
      begun the plea wark, though, maybe, when ye consider the renown and credit
      I have by it, ye will hardly believe what I am saying.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed, friend,&rsquo; said Joshua, with a sigh, &lsquo;I am glad thou hast found
      anything in the legal contention which compensates thee for poverty and
      hunger; but I believe, were other human objects of ambition looked upon as
      closely, their advantages would be found as chimerical as those attending
      thy protracted litigation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But never mind, friend,&rsquo; said Peter, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you the exact state of
      the conjunct processes, and make you sensible that I can bring mysell
      round with a wet finger, now I have my finger and my thumb on this
      loup-the-dike loon, the lad Fairford.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan Fairford was in the act of speaking to the masked lady (for Miss
      Redgauntlet had retained her riding vizard) endeavouring to assure her, as
      he perceived her anxiety, of such protection as he could afford, when his
      own name, pronounced in a loud tone, attracted his attention. He looked
      round, and seeing Peter Peebles, as hastily turned to avoid his notice, in
      which he succeeded, so earnest was Peter upon his colloquy with one of the
      most respectable auditors whose attention he had ever been able to engage.
      And by this little motion, momentary as it was, Alan gained an unexpected
      advantage; for while he looked round, Miss Lilias, I could never ascertain
      why, took the moment to adjust her mask, and did it so awkwardly, that
      when her companion again turned his head, he recognized as much of her
      features as authorized him to address her as his fair client, and to press
      his offers of protection and assistance with the boldness of a former
      acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lilias Redgauntlet withdrew the mask from her crimsoned cheek. &lsquo;Mr.
      Fairford,&rsquo; she said, in a voice almost inaudible, &lsquo;you have the character
      of a young gentleman of sense and generosity; but we have already met in
      one situation which you must think singular; and I must be exposed to
      misconstruction, at least, for my forwardness, were it not in a cause in
      which my dearest affections were concerned.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Any interest in my beloved friend Darsie Latimer,&rsquo; said Fairford,
      stepping a little back, and putting a marked restraint upon his former
      advances, &lsquo;gives me a double right to be useful to&rsquo;&mdash;He stopped
      short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To his sister, your goodness would say,&rsquo; answered Lilias.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His sister, madam!&rsquo; replied Alan, in the extremity of astonishment&mdash;&lsquo;Sister,
      I presume, in affection only?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, sir; my dear brother Darsie and I are connected by the bonds of
      actual relationship; and I am not sorry to be the first to tell this to
      the friend he most values.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fairford&rsquo;s first thought was on the violent passion which Darsie had
      expressed towards the fair unknown. &lsquo;Good God!&rsquo; he exclaimed, &lsquo;how did he
      bear the discovery?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With resignation, I hope,&rsquo; said Lilias, smiling. &lsquo;A more accomplished
      sister he might easily have come by, but scarcely could have found one who
      could love him more than I do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I meant&mdash;I only meant to say,&rsquo; said the young counsellor, his
      presence of mind failing him for an instant&mdash;&lsquo;that is, I meant to ask
      where Darsie Latimer is at this moment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In this very house, and under the guardianship of his uncle, whom I
      believe you knew as a visitor of your father, under the name of Mr.
      Herries of Birrenswork.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me hasten to him,&rsquo; said Fairford; &lsquo;I have sought him through
      difficulties and dangers&mdash;I must see him instantly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You forget you are a prisoner,&rsquo; said the young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;True&mdash;true; but I cannot be long detained&mdash;the cause alleged is
      too ridiculous.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; said Lilias, &lsquo;our fate&mdash;my brother&rsquo;s and mine, at least&mdash;must
      turn on the deliberations perhaps of less than an hour. For you, sir, I
      believe and apprehend nothing; but some restraint; my uncle is neither
      cruel nor unjust, though few will go further in the cause which he has
      adopted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which is that of the Pretend&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake speak lower!&rsquo; said Lilias, approaching her hand, as if to
      stop him. &lsquo;The word may cost you your life. You do not know&mdash;indeed
      you do not&mdash;the terrors of the situation in which we at present
      stand, and in which I fear you also are involved by your friendship for my
      brother.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not indeed know the particulars of our situation,&rsquo; said Fairford;
      &lsquo;but, be the danger what it may, I shall not grudge my share of it for the
      sake of my friend; or,&rsquo; he added, with more timidity, &lsquo;of my friend&rsquo;s
      sister. Let me hope,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;my dear Miss Latimer, that my presence may
      be of some use to you; and that it may be so, let me entreat a share of
      your confidence, which I am conscious I have otherwise no right to ask.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He led her, as he spoke, towards the recess of the farther window of the
      room, and observing to her that, unhappily, he was particularly exposed to
      interruption from the mad old man whose entrance had alarmed her, he
      disposed of Darsie Latimer&rsquo;s riding-skirt, which had been left in the
      apartment, over the back of two chairs, forming thus a sort of screen,
      behind which he ensconced himself with the maiden of the green mantle;
      feeling at the moment, that the danger in which he was placed was almost
      compensated by the intelligence which permitted those feelings towards her
      to revive, which justice to his friend had induced him to stifle in the
      birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The relative situation of adviser and advised, of protector and protected,
      is so peculiarly suited to the respective condition of man and woman, that
      great progress towards intimacy is often made in very short space; for the
      circumstances call for confidence on the part of the gentleman, and forbid
      coyness on that of the lady, so that the usual barriers against easy
      intercourse are at once thrown down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under these circumstances, securing themselves as far as possible from
      observation, conversing in whispers, and seated in a corner, where they
      were brought into so close contact that their faces nearly touched each
      other, Fairford heard from Lilias Redgauntlet the history of her family,
      particularly of her uncle; his views upon her brother, and the agony which
      she felt, lest at that very moment he might succeed in engaging Darsie in
      some desperate scheme, fatal to his fortune and perhaps to his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan Fairford&rsquo;s acute understanding instantly connected what he had heard
      with the circumstances he had witnessed at Fairladies. His first thought
      was, to attempt, at all risks, his instant escape, and procure assistance
      powerful enough to crush, in the very cradle, a conspiracy of such a
      determined character. This he did not consider as difficult; for, though
      the door was guarded on the outside, the window, which was not above ten
      feet from the ground, was open for escape, the common on which it looked
      was unenclosed, and profusely covered with furze. There would, he thought,
      be little difficulty in effecting his liberty, and in concealing his
      course after he had gained it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Lilias exclaimed against this scheme. Her uncle, she said, was a man
      who, in his moments of enthusiasm, knew neither remorse nor fear. He was
      capable of visiting upon Darsie any injury which he might conceive
      Fairford had rendered him&mdash;he was her near kinsman also, and not an
      unkind one, and she deprecated any effort, even in her brother&rsquo;s favour,
      by which his life must be exposed to danger. Fairford himself remembered
      Father Buonaventure, and made little question but that he was one of the
      sons of the old Chevalier de Saint George; and with feelings which,
      although contradictory of his public duty, can hardly be much censured,
      his heart recoiled from being the agent by whom the last scion of such a
      long line of Scottish princes should be rooted up. He then thought of
      obtaining an audience, if possible, of this devoted person, and explaining
      to him the utter hopelessness of his undertaking, which he judged it
      likely that the ardour of his partisans might have concealed from him. But
      he relinquished this design as soon as formed. He had no doubt, that any
      light which he could throw on the state of the country, would come too
      late to be serviceable to one who was always reported to have his own full
      share of the hereditary obstinacy which had cost his ancestors so dear,
      and who, in drawing the sword, must have thrown from him the scabbard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lilias suggested the advice which, of all others, seemed most suited to
      the occasion, that, yielding, namely, to the circumstances of their
      situation, they should watch carefully when Darsie should obtain any
      degree of freedom, and endeavour to open a communication with him, in
      which case their joint flight might be effected, and without endangering
      the safety of any one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their youthful deliberation had nearly fixed in this point, when Fairford,
      who was listening to the low sweet whispering tones of Lilias Redgauntlet,
      rendered yet more interesting by some slight touch of foreign accent, was
      startled by a heavy hand which descended with full weight on his shoulder,
      while the discordant voice of Peter Peebles, who had at length broke loose
      from the well-meaning Quaker, exclaimed in the ear of his truant counsel&mdash;&lsquo;Aha,
      lad! I think ye are catched&mdash;An&rsquo; so ye are turned chamber-counsel,
      are ye? And ye have drawn up wi&rsquo; clients in scarfs and hoods? But bide a
      wee, billie, and see if I dinna sort ye when my petition and complaint
      comes to be discussed, with or without answers, under certification.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan Fairford had never more difficulty in his life to subdue a first
      emotion, than he had to refrain from knocking down the crazy blockhead who
      had broken in upon him at such a moment. But the length of Peter&rsquo;s address
      gave him time, fortunately perhaps for both parties, to reflect on the
      extreme irregularity of such a proceeding. He stood silent, however, with
      vexation, while Peter went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Weel, my bonnie man, I see ye are thinking shame o&rsquo; yoursell, and nae
      great wonder. Ye maun leave this quean&mdash;the like of her is ower light
      company for you. I have heard honest Mr. Pest say, that the gown grees ill
      wi&rsquo; the petticoat. But come awa hame to your puir father, and I&rsquo;ll take
      care of you the haill gate, and keep you company, and deil a word we will
      speak about, but just the state of the conjoined processes of the great
      cause of Poor Peter Peebles against Plainstanes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If thou canst; endure to hear as much of that suit, friend,&rsquo; said the
      Quaker, &lsquo;as I have heard out of mere compassion for thee, I think verily
      thou wilt soon be at the bottom of the matter, unless it be altogether
      bottomless.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fairford shook off, rather indignantly, the large bony hand which Peter
      had imposed upon his shoulder, and was about to say something peevish,
      upon so unpleasant and insolent a mode of interruption, when the door
      opened, a treble voice saying to the sentinel, &lsquo;I tell you I maun be in,
      to see if Mr. Nixon&rsquo;s here;&rsquo; and little Benjie thrust in his mop-head and
      keen black eyes. Ere he could withdraw it, Peter Peebles sprang to the
      door, seized on the boy by the collar, and dragged him forward into the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me see it,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;ye ne&rsquo;er-do-weel limb of Satan&mdash;I&rsquo;ll gar
      you satisfy the production, I trow&mdash;I&rsquo;ll hae first and second
      diligence against you, ye deevil&rsquo;s buckie!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What dost thou want?&rsquo; said the Quaker, interfering; &lsquo;why dost thou
      frighten the boy, friend Peebles?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I gave the bastard a penny to buy me snuff,&rsquo; said the pauper, &lsquo;and he has
      rendered no account of his intromissions; but I&rsquo;ll gar him as gude.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he proceeded forcibly to rifle the pockets of Benjie&rsquo;s ragged
      jacket of one or two snares for game, marbles, a half-bitten apple, two
      stolen eggs (one of which Peter broke in the eagerness of his research),
      and various other unconsidered trifles, which had not the air of being
      very honestly come by. The little rascal, under this discipline, bit and
      struggled like a fox-cub, but, like that vermin, uttered neither cry nor
      complaint, till a note, which Peter tore from his bosom, flew as far as
      Lilias Redgauntlet, and fell at her feet. It was addressed to C. N.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is for the villain Nixon.&rsquo; she said to Alan Fairford; &lsquo;open it without
      scruple; that boy is his emissary; we shall now see what the miscreant is
      driving at.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Benjie now gave up all further struggle, and suffered Peebles to
      take from him, without resistance, a shilling, out of which Peter declared
      he would pay himself principal and interest, and account for the balance.
      The boy, whose attention seemed fixed on something very different, only
      said, &lsquo;Maister Nixon will murder me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alan Fairford did not hesitate to read the little scrap of paper, on which
      was written, &lsquo;All is prepared&mdash;keep them in play until I come up. You
      may depend on your reward.&mdash;C. C.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alas, my uncle&mdash;my poor uncle!&rsquo; said Lilias; &lsquo;this is the result of
      his confidence. Methinks, to give him instant notice of his confidant&rsquo;s
      treachery, is now the best service we can render all concerned&mdash;if
      they break up their undertaking, as they must now do, Darsie will be at
      liberty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same breath, they were both at the half-opened door of the room,
      Fairford entreating to speak with the Father Buonaventure, and Lilias,
      equally vehemently, requesting a moment&rsquo;s interview with her uncle. While
      the sentinel hesitated what to do, his attention was called to a loud
      noise at the door, where a crowd had been assembled in consequence of the
      appalling cry, that the enemy were upon them, occasioned, as it afterwards
      proved, by some stragglers having at length discovered the dead bodies of
      Nanty Ewart and of Nixon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amid the confusion occasioned by this alarming incident, the sentinel
      ceased to attend, to his duty; and accepting Alan Fairford&rsquo;s arm, Lilias
      found no opposition in penetrating even to the inner apartment, where the
      principal persons in the enterprise, whose conclave had been disturbed by
      this alarming incident, were now assembled in great confusion, and had
      been joined by the Chevalier himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only a mutiny among these smuggling scoundrels,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      ONLY a mutiny, do you say?&rsquo; said Sir Richard Glendale; &lsquo;and the lugger,
      the last hope of escape for,&rsquo;&mdash;he looked towards Charles,&mdash;&lsquo;stands
      out to sea under a press of sail!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not concern yourself about me,&rsquo; said the unfortunate prince; &lsquo;this is
      not the worst emergency in which it has been my lot to stand; and if it
      were, I fear it not. Shift for yourselves, my lords and gentlemen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, never!&rsquo; said the young Lord &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. &lsquo;Our only hope now
      is in an honourable resistance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Most true,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet; &lsquo;let despair renew the union amongst us
      which accident disturbed. I give my voice for displaying the royal banner
      instantly, and&mdash;How now!&rsquo; he concluded, sternly, as Lilias, first
      soliciting his attention by pulling his cloak, put into his hand the
      scroll, and added, it was designed for that of Nixon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Redgauntlet read&mdash;and, dropping it on the ground, continued to stare
      upon the spot where it fell, with raised hands and fixed eyes. Sir Richard
      Glendale lifted the fatal paper, read it, and saying, &lsquo;Now all is indeed
      over,&rsquo; handed it to Maxwell, who said aloud, &lsquo;Black Colin Campbell, by G&mdash;d!
      I heard he had come post from London last night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As if in echo to his thoughts, the violin of the blind man was heard,
      playing with spirit, The Campbells are coming,&rsquo; a celebrated clan-march.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Campbells are coming in earnest,&rsquo; said MacKellar; they are upon us
      with the whole battalion from Carlisle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence of dismay, and two or three of the company began to
      drop out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; spoke with the generous spirit of a young
      English nobleman. &lsquo;If we have been fools, do not let us be cowards. We
      have one here more precious than us all, and come hither on our warranty&mdash;let
      us save him at least.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;True, most true,&rsquo; answered Sir Richard Glendale. &lsquo;Let the king be first
      cared for.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That shall be my business,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet &lsquo;if we have but time to
      bring back the brig, all will be well&mdash;I will instantly dispatch a
      party in a fishing skiff to bring her to.&rsquo; He gave his commands to two or
      three of the most active among his followers. &lsquo;Let him be once on board,&rsquo; 
      he said, &lsquo;and there are enough of us to stand to arms and cover his
      retreat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Right, right,&rsquo; said Sir Richard, &lsquo;and I will look to points which can be
      made defensible; and the old powder-plot boys could not have made a more
      desperate resistance than we shall. Redgauntlet,&rsquo; continued he, &lsquo;I see
      some of our friends are looking pale; but methinks your nephew has more
      mettle in his eye now than when we were in cold deliberation, with danger
      at a distance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is the way of our house,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet; &lsquo;our courage ever kindles
      highest on the losing side. I, too, feel that the catastrophe I have
      brought on must not be survived by its author. Let me first,&rsquo; he said,
      addressing Charles, &lsquo;see your Majesty&rsquo;s sacred person in such safety as
      can now be provided for it, and then&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may spare all considerations concerning me, gentlemen,&rsquo; again
      repeated Charles; &lsquo;yon mountain of Criffel shall fly as soon as I will.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Most threw themselves at his feet with weeping and entreaty; some one or
      two slunk in confusion from the apartment, and were heard riding off.
      Unnoticed in such a scene, Darsie, his sister, and Fairford, drew
      together, and held each other by the hands, as those who, when a vessel is
      about to founder in the storm, determine to take their chance of life and
      death together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amid this scene of confusion, a gentleman, plainly dressed in a
      riding-habit, with a black cockade in his hat, but without any arms except
      a COUTEAU-DE-CHASSE, walked into the apartment without ceremony. He was a
      tall, thin, gentlemanly man, with a look and bearing decidedly military.
      He had passed through their guards, if in the confusion they now
      maintained any, without stop or question, and now stood, almost unarmed,
      among armed men, who nevertheless, gazed on him as on the angel of
      destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You look coldly on me, gentlemen,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Sir Richard Glendale&mdash;my
      Lord &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, we were not always such strangers. Ha,
      Pate-in-Peril, how is it with you? and you, too, Ingoldsby&mdash;I must
      not call you by any other name&mdash;why do you receive an old friend so
      coldly? But you guess my errand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And are prepared for it, general,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet; &lsquo;we are not men to
      be penned up like sheep for the slaughter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pshaw! you take it too seriously&mdash;let me speak but one word with
      you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No words can shake our purpose,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet, were your whole
      command, as I suppose is the case, drawn round the house.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am certainly not unsupported,&rsquo; said the general; &lsquo;but if you would hear
      me&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hear ME, sir,&rsquo; said the Wanderer, stepping forward; &lsquo;I suppose I am the
      mark you aim at&mdash;I surrender myself willingly, to save these
      gentlemen&rsquo;s danger&mdash;let this at least avail in their favour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      An exclamation of &lsquo;Never, never!&rsquo; broke from the little body of partisans,
      who threw themselves round the unfortunate prince, and would have seized
      or struck down Campbell, had it not been that he remained with his arms
      folded, and a look, rather indicating impatience because they would not
      hear him, than the least apprehension of violence at their hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he obtained a moment&rsquo;s silence. &lsquo;I do not,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;know this
      gentleman&rsquo;&mdash;(making a profound bow to the unfortunate prince)&mdash;&lsquo;I
      do not wish to know him; it is a knowledge which would suit neither of
      us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our ancestors, nevertheless, have been well acquainted,&rsquo; said Charles,
      unable to suppress, even at that hour of dread and danger, the painful
      recollections of fallen royalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In one word, General Campbell,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet, &lsquo;is it to be peace or
      war? You are a man of honour, and we can trust you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thank you, sir,&rsquo; said the general; &lsquo;and I reply, that the answer to
      your question rests with yourself. Come, do not be fools, gentlemen; there
      was perhaps no great harm meant or intended by your gathering together in
      this obscure corner, for a bear-bait or a cock-fight, or whatever other
      amusement you may have intended, but it was a little imprudent,
      considering how you stand with government, and it has occasioned some
      anxiety. Exaggerated accounts of your purpose have been laid before
      government by the information of a traitor in your own counsels; and I was
      sent down post to take the command of a sufficient number of troops, in
      case these calumnies should be found to have any real foundation. I have
      come here, of course, sufficiently supported both with cavalry and
      infantry, to do whatever might be necessary; but my commands are&mdash;and
      I am sure they agree with my inclination&mdash;to make no arrests, nay, to
      make no further inquiries of any kind, if this good assembly will consider
      their own interest so far as to give up their immediate purpose, and
      return quietly home to their own houses.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What!&mdash;all?&rsquo; exclaimed Sir Richard Glendale&mdash;&lsquo;all, without
      exception?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;ALL, without one single exception&rsquo; said the general; &lsquo;such are my orders.
      If you accept my terms, say so, and make haste; for things may happen to
      interfere with his Majesty&rsquo;s kind purposes towards you all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Majesty&rsquo;s kind purposes!&rsquo; said the Wanderer. &lsquo;Do I hear you aright, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I speak the king&rsquo;s very words, from his very lips,&rsquo; replied the general.
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said his Majesty, &ldquo;deserve the confidence of my subjects by
      reposing my security in the fidelity of the millions who acknowledge my
      title&mdash;in the good sense and prudence of the few who continue, from
      the errors of education, to disown it.&rdquo; His Majesty will not even believe
      that the most zealous Jacobites who yet remain can nourish a thought of
      exciting a civil war, which must be fatal to their families and
      themselves, besides spreading bloodshed and ruin through a peaceful land.
      He cannot even believe of his kinsman, that he would engage brave and
      generous though mistaken men, in an attempt which must ruin all who have
      escaped former calamities; and he is convinced, that, did curiosity or any
      other motive lead that person to visit this country, he would soon see it
      was his wisest course to return to the continent; and his Majesty
      compassionates his situation too much to offer any obstacle to his doing
      so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is this real?&rsquo; said Redgauntlet. &lsquo;Can you mean this? Am I&mdash;are all,
      are any of these gentlemen at liberty, without interruption, to embark in
      yonder brig, which, I see, is now again approaching the shore?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You, sir&mdash;all&mdash;any of the gentlemen present,&rsquo; said the general,&mdash;&lsquo;all
      whom the vessel can contain, are at liberty to embark uninterrupted by me;
      but I advise none to go off who have not powerful reasons unconnected with
      the present meeting, for this will be remembered against no one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then, gentlemen,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet, clasping his hands together as the
      words burst from him, &lsquo;the cause is lost for ever!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      General Campbell turned away to the window, as if to avoid hearing what
      they said. Their consultation was but momentary; for the door of escape
      which thus opened was as unexpected as the exigence was threatening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have your word of honour for our protection,&rsquo; said Sir Richard
      Glendale, &lsquo;if we dissolve our meeting in obedience to your summons?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have, Sir Richard,&rsquo; answered the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I also have your promise,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet, &lsquo;that I may go on board
      yonder vessel, with any friend whom I may choose to accompany me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only that, Mr. Ingoldsby&mdash;or I WILL call you Mr. Redgauntlet once
      more&mdash;you may stay in the offing for a tide, until you are joined by
      any person who may remain at Fairladies. After that, there will be a sloop
      of war on the station, and I need not say your condition will then become
      perilous.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perilous it should not be, General Campbell,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet, &lsquo;or more
      perilous to others than to us, if others thought as I do even in this
      extremity.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You forget yourself, my friend,&rsquo; said the unhappy Adventurer; you forget
      that the arrival of this gentleman only puts the cope-stone on our already
      adopted resolution to abandon our bull-fight or by whatever other wild
      name this headlong enterprise may be termed. I bid you farewell,
      unfriendly friends&mdash;I bid you farewell,&rsquo; (bowing to the general) &lsquo;my
      friendly foe&mdash;I leave this strand as I landed upon it, alone and to
      return no more!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not alone,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet, &lsquo;while there is blood in the veins of my
      father&rsquo;s son.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not alone,&rsquo; said the other gentlemen present, stung with feelings which
      almost overpowered the better reasons under which they had acted. &lsquo;We will
      not disown our principles, or see your person endangered.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it be only your purpose to see the gentleman to the beach,&rsquo; said
      General Campbell, &lsquo;I will myself go with you. My presence among you,
      unarmed, and in your power, will be a pledge of my friendly intentions,
      and will overawe, should such be offered, any interruption on the part of
      officious persons.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be it so,&rsquo; said the Adventurer, with the air of a prince to a subject,
      not of one who complied with the request of an enemy too powerful to be
      resisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      They left the apartment&mdash;they left the house&mdash;an unauthenticated
      and dubious, but appalling, sensation of terror had already spread itself
      among the inferior retainers, who had so short time before strutted, and
      bustled, and thronged the doorway and the passages. A report had arisen,
      of which the origin could not be traced, of troops advancing towards the
      spot in considerable numbers; and men who, for one reason or other, were
      most of them amenable to the arm of power, had either shrunk into stables
      or corners, or fled the place entirely. There was solitude on the
      landscape excepting the small party which now moved towards the rude pier,
      where a boat lay manned, agreeably to Redgauntlet&rsquo;s orders previously
      given.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last heir of the Stuarts leant on Redgauntlet&rsquo;s arm as they walked
      towards the beach; for the ground was rough, and he no longer possessed
      the elasticity of limb and of spirit which had, twenty years before,
      carried him over many a Highland hill as light as one of their native
      deer. His adherents followed, looking on the ground, their feelings
      struggling against the dictates of their reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Campbell accompanied them with an air of apparent ease and
      indifference, but watching, at the same time, and no doubt with some
      anxiety, the changing features of those who acted in this extraordinary
      scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darsie and his sister naturally followed their uncle, whose violence they
      no longer feared, while his character attracted their respect, and Alan
      Fairford attended them from interest in their fate, unnoticed in a party
      where all were too much occupied with their own thoughts and feelings, as
      well as with the impending crisis, to attend to his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-way betwixt the house and the beach, they saw the bodies of Nanty
      Ewart and Cristal Nixon blackening in the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That was your informer?&rsquo; said Redgauntlet, looking back to General
      Campbell, who only nodded his assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Caitiff wretch!&rsquo; exclaimed Redgauntlet;&mdash;&lsquo;and yet the name were
      better bestowed on the fool who could be misled by thee.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That sound broadsword cut,&rsquo; said the general, &lsquo;has saved us the shame of
      rewarding a traitor.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They arrived at the place of embarkation. The prince stood a moment with
      folded arms, and looked around him in deep silence. A paper was then
      slipped into his hands&mdash;he looked at it, and said, &lsquo;I find the two
      friends I have left at Fairladies are apprised of my destination, and
      propose to embark from Bowness. I presume this will not be an infringement
      of the conditions under which you have acted?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; answered General Campbell; &lsquo;they shall have all facility
      to join you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish, then,&rsquo; said Charles, &lsquo;only another companion. Redgauntlet, the
      air of this country is as hostile to you as it is to me. These gentlemen
      have made their peace, or rather they have done nothing to break it. But
      you&mdash;come you and share my home where chance shall cast it. We shall
      never see these shores again; but we will talk of them, and of our
      disconcerted bull-fight.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I follow you, sire, through life,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet, &lsquo;as I would have
      followed you to death. Permit me one moment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince then looked round, and seeing the abashed countenances of his
      other adherents bent upon the ground, he hastened to say, &lsquo;Do not think
      that you, gentlemen, have obliged me less because your zeal was mingled
      with prudence, entertained, I am sure, more on my own account and on that
      of your country, than from selfish apprehensions.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped from one to another, and, amid sobs and bursting tears,
      received the adieus of the last remnant which had hitherto supported his
      lofty pretensions, and addressed them individually with accents of
      tenderness and affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general drew a little aloof, and signed to Redgauntlet to speak with
      him while this scene proceeded. &lsquo;It is now all over,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and
      Jacobite will be henceforward no longer a party name. When you tire of
      foreign parts, and wish to make your peace, let me know. Your restless
      zeal alone has impeded your pardon hitherto.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now I shall not need it,&rsquo; said Redgauntlet. &lsquo;I leave England for
      ever; but I am not displeased that you should hear my family adieus.&mdash;Nephew,
      come hither. In presence of General Campbell, I tell you, that though to
      breed you up in my own political opinions has been for many years my
      anxious wish, I am now glad that it could not be accomplished. You pass
      under the service of the reigning monarch without the necessity of
      changing your allegiance&mdash;a change, however,&rsquo; he added, looking
      around him, which sits more easy on honourable men than I could have
      anticipated; but some wear the badge of their loyalty on their sleeve, and
      others in the heart. You will, from henceforth, be uncontrolled master of
      all the property of which forfeiture could not deprive your father&mdash;of
      all that belonged to him&mdash;excepting this, his good sword&rsquo; (laying his
      hand on the weapon he wore), &lsquo;which shall never fight for the House of
      Hanover; and as my hand will never draw weapon more, I shall sink it forty
      fathoms deep in the wide ocean. Bless you, young man! If I have dealt
      harshly with you, forgive me. I had set my whole desires on one point,&mdash;God
      knows, with no selfish purpose; and I am justly punished by this final
      termination of my views, for having been too little scrupulous in the
      means by which I pursued them.&mdash;Niece, farewell, and may God bless
      you also!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, sir,&rsquo; said Lilias, seizing his hand eagerly. &lsquo;You have been hitherto
      my protector,&mdash;you are now in sorrow, let me be your attendant and
      your comforter in exile.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thank you, my girl, for your unmerited affection; but it cannot and
      must not be. The curtain here falls between us. I go to the house of
      another. If I leave it before I quit the earth, it shall be only for the
      House of God. Once more, farewell both! The fatal doom,&rsquo; he said, with a
      melancholy smile, &lsquo;will, I trust, now depart from the House of
      Redgauntlet, since its present representative has adhered to the winning
      side. I am convinced he will not change it, should it in turn become the
      losing one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The unfortunate Charles Edward had now given his last adieus to his
      downcast adherents. He made a sign with his hand to Redgauntlet, who came
      to assist him into the skiff. General Campbell also offered his
      assistance, the rest appearing too much affected by the scene which had
      taken place to prevent him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are not sorry, general, to do me this last act of courtesy,&rsquo; said the
      Chevalier; &lsquo;and, on my part, I thank you for it. You have taught me the
      principle on which men on the scaffold feel forgiveness and kindness even
      for their executioner. Farewell!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They were seated in the boat, which presently pulled off from the land.
      The Oxford divine broke out into a loud benediction, in terms which
      General Campbell was too generous to criticize at the time, or to remember
      afterwards;&mdash;nay, it is said, that, Whig and Campbell as he was, he
      could not help joining in the universal Amen! which resounded from the
      shore.

    <h2>
      CONCLUSION, BY DR. DRYASDUST
    </h2>
    <h3>
      IN A LETTER TO THE AUTHOR OF WAVERLEY
    </h3>
    <p>
      I am truly sorry, my worthy and much-respected sir, that my anxious
      researches have neither, in the form of letters, nor of diaries or other
      memoranda, been able to discover more than I have hitherto transmitted, of
      the history of the Redgauntlet family. But I observe in an old newspaper
      called the WHITEHALL GAZETTE, of which I fortunately possess a file for
      several years, that Sir Arthur Darsie Redgauntlet was presented to his
      late Majesty at the drawing-room, by Lieut.-General Campbell&mdash;upon
      which the editor observes, in the way of comment, that we were going,
      REMIS ATQUE VELIS, into the interests of the Pretender, since a Scot had
      presented a Jacobite at Court. I am sorry I have not room (the frank being
      only uncial) for his further observations, tending to show the
      apprehensions entertained by many well-instructed persons of the period,
      that the young king might himself be induced to become one of the Stuarts&rsquo; 
      faction,&mdash;a catastrophe from which it has pleased Heaven to preserve
      these kingdoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      I perceive also, by a marriage-contract in the family repositories, that
      Miss Lilias Redgauntlet of Redgauntlet, about eighteen months after the
      transactions you have commemorated, intermarried with Alan Fairford, Esq.,
      Advocate, of Clinkdollar, who, I think, we may not unreasonably conclude
      to be the same person whose name occurs so frequently in the pages of your
      narration. In my last excursion to Edinburgh, I was fortunate enough to
      discover an old caddie, from whom, at the expense of a bottle of whisky
      and half a pound of tobacco, I extracted the important information, that
      he knew Peter Peebles very well, and had drunk many a mutchkin with him in
      Caddie Fraser&rsquo;s time. He said &lsquo;that he lived ten years after King George&rsquo;s
      accession, in the momentary expectation of winning his cause every day in
      the session time, and every hour in the day, and at last fell down dead,
      in what my informer called a &lsquo;perplexity fit,&rsquo; upon a proposal for a
      composition being made to him in the Outer House. I have chosen to retain
      my informer&rsquo;s phrase, not being able justly to determine whether it is a
      corruption of the word apoplexy, as my friend Mr. Oldbuck supposes, or the
      name of some peculiar disorder incidental to those who have concern in the
      courts of law, as many callings and conditions of men have diseases
      appropriate to themselves. The same caddie also remembered Blind Willie
      Stevenson, who was called Wandering Willie, and who ended his days &lsquo;unco
      beinly, in Sir Arthur Redgauntlet&rsquo;s ha&rsquo; neuk.&rsquo; &lsquo;He had done the family
      some good turn,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;specially when ane of the Argyle gentlemen was
      coming down on a wheen of them that had the &ldquo;auld leaven&rdquo; about them, and
      wad hae taen every man of them, and nae less nor headed and hanged them.
      But Willie, and a friend they had, called Robin the Rambler, gae them
      warning, by playing tunes such as &ldquo;The Campbells are coming&rdquo; and the like,
      whereby they got timeous warning to take the wing.&rsquo; I need not point out
      to your acuteness, my worthy sir, that this seems to refer to some
      inaccurate account of the transactions in which you seem so much
      interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Respecting Redgauntlet, about whose subsequent history you are more
      particularly inquisitive, I have learned from an excellent person who was
      a priest in the Scottish Monastery of Ratisbon, before its suppression,
      that he remained for two or three years in the family of the Chevalier,
      and only left it at last in consequence of some discords in that
      melancholy household. As he had hinted to General Campbell, he exchanged
      his residence for the cloister, and displayed in the latter part of his
      life, a strong sense of the duties of religion, which in his earlier days
      he had too much neglected, being altogether engaged in political
      speculations and intrigues. He rose to the situation of prior, in the
      house which he belonged to, and which was of a very strict order of
      religion. He sometimes received his countrymen, whom accident brought to
      Ratisbon, and curiosity induced to visit the Monastery of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.
      But it was remarked, that though he listened with interest and attention,
      when Britain, or particularly Scotland, became the subject of
      conversation, yet he never either introduced or prolonged the subject,
      never used the English language, never inquired about English affairs,
      and, above all, never mentioned his own family. His strict observation of
      the rules of his order gave him, at the time of his death, some
      pretensions to be chosen a saint, and the brethren of the Monastery of
      &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; made great efforts for that effect, and brought
      forward some plausible proofs of miracles. But there was a circumstance
      which threw a doubt over the subject, and prevented the consistory from
      acceding to the wishes of the worthy brethren. Under his habit, and
      secured in a small silver box, he had worn perpetually around his neck a
      lock of-hair, which the fathers avouched to be a relic. But the Avvocato
      del Diabolo, in combating (as was his official duty) the pretensions of
      the candidate for sanctity, made it at least equally probable that the
      supposed relic was taken from the head of a brother of the deceased prior,
      who had been executed for adherence to the Stuart family in 1745-6; and
      the motto, HAUD OBLIVISCENDUM, seemed to intimate a tone of mundane
      feeling and recollection of injuries, which made it at least doubtful
      whether, even in the quiet and gloom of the cloister, Father Hugo had
      forgotten the sufferings and injuries of the House of Redgauntlet.

    <h2>
      NOTES
    </h2>
    <h3>
      NOTE 1.&mdash;THE SOCIETY OF FRIENDS
    </h3>
    <p>
      In explanation of this circumstance, I cannot help adding a note not very
      necessary for the reader, which yet I record with pleasure, from
      recollection of the kindness which it evinces. In early youth I resided
      for a considerable time in the vicinity of the beautiful village of Kelso,
      where my life passed in a very solitary manner. I had few acquaintances,
      scarce any companions, and books, which were at the time almost essential
      to my happiness, were difficult to come by. It was then that I was
      particularly indebted to the liberality and friendship of an old lady of
      the Society of Friends, eminent for her benevolence and charity. Her
      deceased husband had been a medical man of eminence, and left her, with
      other valuable property, a small and well-selected library. This the kind
      old lady permitted me to rummage at pleasure, and carry home what volumes
      I chose, on condition that I should take, at the same time, some of the
      tracts printed for encouraging and extending the doctrines of her own
      sect. She did not even exact any promise that I would read these
      performances, being too justly afraid of involving me in a breach of
      promise, but was merely desirous that I should have the chance of
      instruction within my reach, in case whim, curiosity, or accident, might
      induce me to have recourse to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      NOTE 2.&mdash;THE PERSECUTORS
    </p>
    <p>
      The personages here mentioned are most of them characters of historical
      fame; but those less known and remembered may be found in the tract
      entitled, &lsquo;The Judgment and Justice of God Exemplified, or, a Brief
      Historical Account of some of the Wicked Lives and Miserable Deaths of
      some of the most remarkable Apostates and Bloody Persecutors, from the
      Reformation till after the Revolution.&rsquo; This constitutes a sort of
      postscript or appendix to John Howie of Lochgoin&rsquo;s &lsquo;Account of the Lives
      of the most eminent Scots Worthies.&rsquo; The author has, with considerable
      ingenuity, reversed his reasoning upon the inference to be drawn from the
      prosperity or misfortunes which befall individuals in this world, either
      in the course of their lives or in the hour of death. In the account of
      the martyrs&rsquo; sufferings, such inflictions are mentioned only as trials
      permitted by providence, for the better and brighter display of their
      faith, and constancy of principle. But when similar afflictions befell the
      opposite party, they are imputed to the direct vengeance of Heaven upon
      their impiety. If, indeed, the life of any person obnoxious to the
      historian&rsquo;s censures happened to have passed in unusual prosperity, the
      mere fact of its being finally concluded by death, is assumed as an
      undeniable token of the judgement of Heaven, and, to render the conclusion
      inevitable, his last scene is generally garnished with some singular
      circumstances. Thus the Duke of Lauderdale is said, through old age but
      immense corpulence, to have become so sunk in spirits, &lsquo;that his heart was
      not the bigness of a walnut.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      NOTE 3.&mdash;LAMENTATION FOR THE DEAD
    </p>
    <p>
      I have heard in my youth some such wild tale as that placed in the mouth
      of the blind fiddler, of which, I think, the hero was Sir Robert Grierson
      of Lagg, the famous persecutor. But the belief was general throughout
      Scotland that the excessive lamentation over the loss of friends disturbed
      the repose of the dead, and broke even the rest of the grave. There are
      several instances of this in tradition, but one struck me particularly, as
      I heard it from the lips of one who professed receiving it from those of a
      ghost-seer. This was a Highland lady, named Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash; of B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      who probably believed firmly in the truth of an apparition which seems to
      have originated in the weakness of her nerves and strength of her
      imagination. She had been lately left a widow by her husband, with the
      office of guardian to their only child. The young man added to the
      difficulties of his charge by an extreme propensity for a military life,
      which his mother was unwilling to give way to, while she found it
      impossible to repress it. About this time the Independent Companies,
      formed for the preservation of the peace of the Highlands, were in the
      course of being levied; and as a gentleman named Cameron, nearly connected
      with Mrs. C&mdash;, commanded one of those companies, she was at length
      persuaded to compromise the matter with her son, by permitting him to
      enter this company in the capacity of a cadet, thus gratifying his love of
      a military life without the dangers of foreign service, to which no one
      then thought these troops were at all liable to be exposed, while even
      their active service at home was not likely to be attended with much
      danger. She readily obtained a promise from her relative that he would be
      particular in his attention to her son and therefore concluded she had
      accommodated matters between her son&rsquo;s wishes and his safety in a way
      sufficiently attentive to both. She set off to Edinburgh to get what was
      awanting for his outfit, and shortly afterwards received melancholy news
      from the Highlands. The Independent Company into which her son was to
      enter had a skirmish with a party of caterans engaged in some act of
      spoil, and her friend the captain being wounded, and out of the reach of
      medical assistance, died in consequence. This news was a thunderbolt to
      the poor mother, who was at once deprived of her kinsman&rsquo;s advice and
      assistance, and instructed by his fate of the unexpected danger to which
      her son&rsquo;s new calling exposed him. She remained also in great sorrow for
      her relative, whom she loved with sisterly affection. These conflicting
      causes of anxiety, together with her uncertainty, whether to continue or
      change her son&rsquo;s destination, were terminated in the following manner:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The house in which Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash; resided in the old town of
      Edinburgh, was a flat or story of a land accessible, as was then
      universal, by a common stair. The family who occupied the story beneath
      were her acquaintances, and she was in the habit of drinking tea with them
      every evening. It was accordingly about six o&rsquo;clock, when, recovering
      herself from a deep fit of anxious reflection, she was about to leave the
      parlour in which she sat in order to attend this engagement. The door
      through which she was to pass opened, as was very common in Edinburgh,
      into a dark passage. In this passage, and within a yard of her when she
      opened the door, stood the apparition of her kinsman, the deceased
      officer, in his full tartans, and wearing his bonnet. Terrified at what
      she saw, or thought she saw, she closed the door hastily, and, sinking on
      her knees by a chair, prayed to be delivered from the horrors of the
      vision. She remained in that posture till her friends below tapped on the
      door, to intimate that tea was ready. Recalled to herself by the signal,
      she arose, and, on opening the apartment door, again was confronted by the
      visionary Highlander, whose bloody brow bore token, on this second
      appearance, to the death he had died. Unable to endure this repetition of
      her terrors, Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash; sank on the door in a swoon. Her friends
      below, startled with the noise, came upstairs, and, alarmed at the
      situation in which they found her, insisted on her going to bed and taking
      some medicine, in order to compose what they took for a nervous attack.
      They had no sooner left her in quiet, than the apparition of the soldier
      was once more visible in the apartment. This time she took courage and
      said, &lsquo;In the name of God, Donald, why do you haunt one who respected and
      loved you when living?&rsquo; To which he answered readily, in Gaelic, &lsquo;Cousin,
      why did you not speak sooner? My rest is disturbed by your unnecessary
      lamentation&mdash;your tears scald me in my shroud. I come to tell you
      that my untimely death ought to make no difference in your views for your
      son; God will raise patrons to supply my place and he will live to the
      fullness of years, and die honoured and at peace.&rsquo; The lady of course
      followed her kinsman&rsquo;s advice and as she was accounted a person of strict
      veracity, we may conclude the first apparition an illusion of the fancy,
      the final one a lively dream suggested by the other two.

      NOTE 4.&mdash;PETER PEEBLES
    </p>
    <p>
      This unfortunate litigant (for a person named Peter Peebles actually
      flourished) frequented the courts of justice in Scotland about the year
      1792, and the sketch of his appearance is given from recollection. The
      author is of opinion that he himself had at one time the honour to be
      counsel for Peter Peebles, whose voluminous course of litigation served as
      a sort of assay-pieces to most young men who were called to the bar. The
      scene of the consultation is entirely imaginary.
    </p>
    <p>
      NOTE 5.&mdash;JOHN&rsquo;S COFFEE-HOUSE
    </p>
    <p>
      This small dark coffee-house, now burnt down, was the resort of such
      writers and clerks belonging to the Parliament House above thirty years
      ago as retained the ancient Scottish custom of a meridian, as it was
      called, or noontide dram of spirits. If their proceedings were watched,
      they might be seen to turn fidgety about the hour of noon, and exchange
      looks with each other from their separate desks, till at length some one
      of formal and dignified presence assumed the honour of leading the band,
      when away they went, threading the crowd like a string of wild fowl,
      crossed the square or close, and following each other into the
      coffee-house, received in turn from the hand of the waiter, the meridian,
      which was placed ready at the bar. This they did, day by day: and though
      they did not speak to each other, they seemed to attach a certain degree
      of sociability to performing the ceremony in company.
    </p>
    <p>
      NOTE 6.&mdash;FISHING RIGHTS
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be here mentioned, that a violent and popular attack upon what the
      country people of this district considered as an invasion of their fishing
      right is by no means an improbable fiction. Shortly after the close of the
      American war, Sir James Graham of Netherby constructed a dam-dyke, or
      cauld, across the Esk, at a place where it flowed through his estate,
      though it has its origin, and the principal part of its course, in
      Scotland. The new barrier at Netherby was considered as an encroachment
      calculated to prevent the salmon from ascending into Scotland, and the
      right of erecting it being an international question of law betwixt the
      sister kingdoms, there was no court in either competent to its decision.
      In this dilemma, the Scots people assembled in numbers by signal of rocket
      lights, and, rudely armed with fowling-pieces, fish-spears, and such
      rustic weapons, marched to the banks of the river for the purpose of
      pulling down the dam-dyke objected to. Sir James Graham armed many of his
      own people to protect his property, and had some military from Carlisle
      for the same purpose. A renewal of the Border wars had nearly taken place
      in the eighteenth century, when prudence and moderation on both sides
      saved much tumult, and perhaps some bloodshed. The English proprietor
      consented that a breach should be made in his dam-dyke sufficient for the
      passage of the fish, and thus removed the Scottish grievance. I believe
      the river has since that time taken the matter into its own disposal, and
      entirely swept away the dam-dyke in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      NOTE 7.&mdash;STATE OF SCOTLAND
    </p>
    <p>
      Scotland, in its half-civilized state, exhibited too many examples of the
      exertion of arbitrary force and violence, rendered easy by the dominion
      which lairds exerted over their tenants and chiefs over their clans. The
      captivity of Lady Grange, in the desolate cliffs of Saint Kilda, is in the
      recollection of every one. At the supposed date of the novel also a man of
      the name of Merrilees, a tanner in Leith, absconded from his country to
      escape his creditors; and after having slain his own mastiff dog, and put
      a bit of red cloth in its mouth, as if it had died in a contest with
      soldiers, and involved his own existence in as much mystery as possible,
      made his escape into Yorkshire. Here he was detected by persons sent in
      search of him, to whom he gave a portentous account of his having been
      carried off and concealed in various places. Mr. Merrilees was, in short,
      a kind of male Elizabeth Canning, but did not trespass on the public
      credulity quite so long.
    </p>
    <p>
      NOTE 8.&mdash;CONCEALMENTS FOR THEFT AND SMUGGLING
    </p>
    <p>
      I am sorry to say that the modes of concealment described in the imaginary
      premises of Mr. Trumbull, are of a kind which have been common on the
      frontiers of late years. The neighbourhood of two nations having different
      laws, though united in government, still leads to a multitude of
      transgressions on the Border, and extreme difficulty in apprehending
      delinquents. About twenty years since, as far as my recollection serves,
      there was along the frontier an organized gang of coiners, forgers,
      smugglers, and other malefactors, whose operations were conducted on a
      scale not inferior to what is here described. The chief of the party was
      one Richard Mendham a carpenter, who rose to opulence, although ignorant
      even of the arts of reading and writing. But he had found a short road to
      wealth, and had taken singular measures for conducting his operations.
      Amongst these, he found means to build, in a suburb of Berwick called
      Spittal, a street of small houses, as if for the investment of property.
      He himself inhabited one of these; another, a species of public-house, was
      open to his confederates, who held secret and unsuspected communication
      with him by crossing the roofs of the intervening houses, and descending
      by a trap-stair, which admitted them into the alcove of the dining-room of
      Dick Mendham&rsquo;s private mansion. A vault, too, beneath Mendham&rsquo;s stable,
      was accessible in the manner mentioned in the novel. The post of one of
      the stalls turned round on a bolt being withdrawn, and gave admittance to
      a subterranean place of concealment for contraband and stolen goods, to a
      great extent. Richard Mendham, the head of this very formidable
      conspiracy, which involved malefactors of every kind, was tried and
      executed at Jedburgh, where the author was present as Sheriff of
      Selkirkshire. Mendham had previously been tried, but escaped by want of
      proof and the ingenuity of his counsel.

    <p>
      NOTE 9&mdash;CORONATION OF GEORGE III
    </p>
    <p>
      In excuse of what may be considered as a violent infraction of probability
      in this chapter, the author is under the necessity of quoting a tradition
      which many persons may recollect having heard. It was always said, though
      with very little appearance of truth, that upon the Coronation of the late
      George III, when the champion of England, Dymock, or his representative,
      appeared in Westminster Hall, and in the language of chivalry solemnly
      wagered his body to defend in single combat the right of the young King to
      the crown of these realms, at the moment when he flung down his gauntlet
      as the gage of battle, an unknown female stepped from the crowd and lifted
      the pledge, leaving another gage in room of it, with a paper expressing,
      that if a fair field of combat should be allowed, a champion of rank and
      birth would appear with equal arms to dispute the claim of King George to
      the British kingdoms. The story is probably one of the numerous fictions
      which were circulated to keep up the spirits of a sinking faction, The
      incident was, however, possible, if it could be supposed to be attended by
      any motive adequate to the risk, and might be imagined to occur to a
      person of Redgauntlet&rsquo;s enthusiastic character. George III, it is said,
      had a police of his own, whose agency was so efficient, that the sovereign
      was able to tell his prime minister upon one occasion, to his great
      surprise, that the Pretender was in London. The prime minister began
      immediately to talk of measures to be taken, warrants to be procured,
      messengers and guards to be got in readiness. &lsquo;Pooh, pooh,&rsquo; said the
      good-natured sovereign, since I have found him out, leave me alone to deal
      with him.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;And what,&rsquo; said the minister, &lsquo;is your Majesty&rsquo;s
      purpose, in so important a case?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;To leave the young man to
      himself,&rsquo; said George III; &lsquo;and when he tires he will go back again.&rsquo; The
      truth of this story does not depend on that of the lifting of the
      gauntlet; and while the latter could be but an idle bravado, the former
      expresses George Ill&rsquo;s goodness of heart and soundness of policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      NOTE 10.&mdash;COLLIER AND SALTER
    </p>
    <p>
      The persons engaged in these occupations were at this time bondsmen; and
      in case they left the ground of the farm to which they belonged, and as
      pertaining to which their services were bought or sold, they were liable
      to be brought back by a summary process. The existence of this species of
      slavery being thought irreconcilable with the spirit of liberty, colliers
      and salters were declared free, and put upon the same footing with other
      servants, by the Act 15 Geo. III chapter 28th. They were so far from
      desiring or prizing the blessing conferred on them, that they esteemed the
      interest taken in their freedom to be a mere decree on the part of the
      proprietors to get rid of what they called head and harigald money,
      payable to them when a female of their number, by bearing a child, made an
      addition to the live stock of their master&rsquo;s property.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
